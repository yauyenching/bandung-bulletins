"It is fitting that bulletin devoted to the Asian-African Conference should begin with a resume of events leading up to the holding of that conference,
For centuries countries in South East Asia have been subjected to the colonial policies of the Western Nations. Colonialism separated these once-colonised countries from each other and prevented their closer cooperation. As colonies they were always pushed in the background and they never participated in the solution of world problems, not even problems affecting their own fates.
Their positions of subjugation to Western nations never allowed them to develop natural resources to the benefit ol their own national economy and remained therefore economically underdeveloped. Colonialism left them with a multitude of problems, to which solutions had to be sought soon they gained their national Independence after World War II. These problems are commion to the newlyborn countries in South and South East Asia. To solve these common problems, the Prime Minister of Ceylon, Sir John Kotelawala, invited the Prime Ministers of Burma, India, Indonesia and Pakistan to meet him in Ceylon for friendly discussions. The need for these friendly discussions Was then felt all the more, when the situation in Indo China grew worse and could therefore easily affect their countries. All these five countries depend for their future and the wellbeing of their peoples upon peace as a prerequisite to their plans of development and reconstruction.
All five countries have economic problems which can only be solved through a degree 8 of industrial development, and, in general, are still strangers to the industrial revolution. Indeed they had many common problems to discuss.
Therefore, the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia and Pakistan met in Ceylon between 28th April and 2nd May, 1954. This meeting was referred to variously as the Conference of Asian Prime Ministers, or as the Colombo Conference from the name of the city where the five Prime Ministers met.
The meeting took place concurrently with the Geneva Conference which aimed at solution of the Indo-China question. The five that France should Asian Premiers proposed at Colombo declare at the Geneva Conference that she is irrevocably committed to the complete independence of Indo-China. They suggested direct negotiations utilisation of the between the parties principally concerned; they looked for good offices and machinery of the United Nations, and they hoped that the Geneva Conference would bring about speedy termination of the conflict.
It was evident that so clear a stand on this issue, taken by five countries who are close neighbours of Indo-China, could not but influence other international discussions, such as the Geneva Conference. It was also plain that this degree of agreement on the Indo-China question would extend to other fields. It did.
Besides detailing the views about the Indo-China question, the final communique of the Conference of SouthEast Asian Prime Ministers (issued at Kandy on 2nd May, 1954) referred also to many other matters, Colonialism was regretted as a violation of fundamental human rights: the claims to independence of Tunisia and Morocco were considered due for recognition: grave concern was expressed for the fate of the Arab refugees in Palestine, and a desire for a just and early settlement of the Palestine problem was expressed. The Prime Ministers affirmed their faith in democracy, exchanged views on the national and international aspects of communism, and determined that, whilst they would respect each other's sovereignty and would not interfere in each other's internal problems, they would resist interference in their internal affairs by Communist or other agencies. They deplored the production of the hydrogen bomb and other implements of mass destruction. They considered representation of the People's. Republic of China in the United Nations Organisation. They considered proposals for economic co-operation and mutual aid and referred these to their respective governments. Apart from expressing satisfaction with the Colombo Conference as paving the way for similar meetings in the future, they finally discussed the desirability of holding a Conference of Asian-African nations and favoured the proposal that the Prime Minister of Indonesia. who had brought forward this suggestion, should explore the possibility of such conference.
Addressing the Indian Council of World Affairs, during his visit to India, on 24th September, 1954, Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo of Indonesia, stated the following:
*At the Colombo Conference it was decided that the possibilities had to be explored of convening a larger Conference of more Asian countries than the original set of five, together with African Nations. This conference will enable us to strengthen our co-operation, to expand our efforts for peace whilst it will also convince the world that this enormous area does not want in its affairs any interference from outside in the realisation of its peaceful policies.
In a radio-broadeast in New Delhi on 25th September 1954, the Indonesian Premier again explained his idea of the Asian-African Conference as follows:“... Asians will have to make decisions on their own future, without interference by the Western World.
There has been a slogan which ran 'Let Asians fight Asians', That is precisely what we do nol want. What we want is to cooperate with our Asian and African neighbours, to live together in friendship and in peaceful co-existence, to strive hard, united in aim, for the common benefit of us all.'
On the same day, 25th September 1954, Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo and Prime Minister Nehru issued a Joint Statement, declaring that:
""*They discussed also the proposal to have a Conference of representatives of Asian and African countries and were agreed that a Conference of this kind was desirable and would be helpful in promoting the cause of peace and common approach to these problems It was-also considered by them that, prior to the meeting of such Conference, it would be advisable for the Prime Ministers of the Colombo Conference countries to mect together, preferably at Djakarta.'
Before returning from his visit to India, and at the invitation of Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma, the Indonesian Premier spent three days in Rangoon for informal talks upon matters of common concern. At the conclusion of this visit a further Joint Statement was issued, which reiterated that the Burmese Premier considered that an Asian-African Conference was desirable and that it would further the cause of world peace.
After these visits, therefore, invitations were again sent to the four other Prime Ministers of the Colombo Conference, this time to a meeting in Indonesia which was to consider and to prepare for the proposed Asian-AfricanConference.
This meeting was eventually held in the mountain town of Bogor, and there the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia and Pakistan met for three days from 28th to 31 st December, 1954, During this Bogor Conference, it was decided that an Asian-African Conference should be held in the month of April, 1955, at Bandung in Indonesia. Four purposes were outlined for this Conference:
1. to promote goodwill and cooperation among the nations of Asia and Africa, to explore and advance their mutual as well as common interests and to establish and further friendliness and neighbourly relations; 2. to consider social, economic and cultural problems and relations of the countries represented;3. to consider problems of special interest to Asian and African peoples, e.g. problems affecting national sovereignty and of racialism and colonialism;4. to view the position of Asia and Africa and their peoples in the world of today and the contribution they can make to the promotion of world peace and cooperation.
It was decided that twenty-five Asian and African five Premiers to countries should be jointly asked by the attend. The twenty-five countries are:
1. Afghanistan 2. Cambodia 3. Central African Federation 4. China 5. Egypt 6. Ethiopia7. Gold Coast 8. Iran Iraq 10. Japan 11. Jordan 12. Laos13. Lebanon 14. Liberia 15. Libya 16. Nepal 17. Philippines 18. Saudi Arabia-19. Sudan 20. Syria 21. Thailand 22. Turkey 23. Viet-Nam (North) 24. Viet-Nam (South) 25. Yemen
What do the Asian-African nations hope to achieve through this meeting? In this connection Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo, before Indian Parliament, when he visited India last September, said: of thinking, and keeping Principles of Pantja Sila, peace in our part of the world cannot be assured by military pacts such as was recently concluded in Manila.There is a better way to the preservation of peace, I mean cooperation and co-existence. In this respect the Colombo Conference has opened a new alley. This Conference had the Geneva Conference. The nations of Asia intervened, and intervened successfully. This showed the world that Asian Problems cannot be solved without Asian Nations.Much has already been achieved; much remains to be done. The views of Asian nations have already become an important factor not only in Asian fairs but in world affairs well. The advantage we have gained must be followed up. The principles of Colombo must be followed up and they must be expanded. We, the nations ofAsia, have friends amongst the nations of the African Continent. ours; to a large extent they face the same problems. To a large extent their position is the same as close Afro-Asian co-operation can be realised, and, submit, will lead to an immense strengthening of the forces strength, the moral and the spiritual strength of the whole marching to peace. We must bear in mind that the will be greater than the strength of the individual parts. To this aim a conference of Afro-Asian countries could lay down the pattern.We are not seeking peace for ourselves alone. Humanity the world over is crying out for peace.Humanity is standing at the cross-roads of history, and much of the responsibility for the future of humanity rests upon us, the peoples of Asia and Africa. We must not shirk that responsibility; we must not mortgage the future we must not endanger that independence, that freedom from foreign domination against which both our nations fought so long and which cost us so many of our dearest and best sons and daughters.'
Now, Indonesia, in close cooperation with Burma, Ceylon, India and Pakistan, as co-sponsoring countries, is working hard for the preparation of the Asian-African Conference. The opening of the Conference fixed for 18th April and it will last for about a week.This is the first time in Indonesia's history that she is called upon to be the host to eminent statesmen and politicians representing more than one half of the world's population. Indonesia is looking forward to welcoming them and is using all means at her disposal towards the holding of a pleasant, cordial and successful Asian-African Conference.",general,,,,
"The Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia and Pakistan met at Bogor on the 28th and 29th December, 1954. The main object of their meeting was to consider matters concerning the proposed Asian-African Conference suggested at the first meeting of the Prime Ministers at Colombo last April.The Prime Ministers took advantage of the opportunity of their present meeting to review briefly, and in general terms, problems and issues of common interest and concern to them all.3. The Prime Ministers agreed that an Asian-African Conference be held under their joint sponsorship. They also reached agreement on all consequential matters.The purposes of the Asian-African Conference would be :
a. to promote goodwill and cooperation between the nations of Asia and Africa, to explore and advance their mutual well common interest and to establish and further friendliness and neighbourly relations; b. to consider social, economic and cultural problems and relations of the countries represented; to consider problems of special interest to Asian and African peoples, e.g. problems affecting national sovereignty and of racialism and colonialism ; d. to view the position of Asia and Africa and their peoples in the world of today and the contribution they can make to the promotion of world peace and cooperation.
5. The Conference will meet in Indonesia in the last week of April 1955. The Government of Indonesia have agreed to make the necessary arrangements for this Conference on behalf of the sponsoring countries. A Conference Secretariat representing the sponsoring countries will be set up in Indonesia.6. The Prime Ministers agreed that the Conference should have a broad and geographical basis, and that all countries in Asia and Africa, which have independent governments, should be invited. With minor variations and modifications of this basic principle, they decided invite the following countries :
1. Afghanistan 2. Cambodia 3. Central African Federation 4. China 5. Egypt 6. Ethiopia 7. Gold Coast 8. Iran 9. Iraq 10. Japan 11. Jordan 12. Laos
13. Lebanon 14. Liberia 15. Libya 16. Nepal 17. Philippines 18. Saudi Arabia 19. Sudan 20. Syria 21. Thailand 22. Turkey 23. Viet-Nam-(North) 24. Viet-Nam (South) 25. Yemen
The above twenty five countries, together with the five sponsoring countries, namely, Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia and Pakistan, will, it is hoped, participate in the Conference.7. Representation at the Conference will be at Ministerial level and it is hoped that each country invited will be represented by her Prime Minister and or Foreign Minister together with such other representatives as cach government might wish to include in its delegation.The Conference will determine its procedure and agenda, the general scope of which is set out in the purposes of the Conference.The Prime Ministers wished to point out that acceptance of the invitation by any one country would in nO way involve or even imply any change in its view of the status of any other country. It implied only that the country invited was in general agreement with the purposes of the Conference, They had also borne in mind the principle that the form of government and the way of life of any one country should in no way be subject to interference by another. Any view expressed at the Conference by one or more participating country would not be binding on or be regarded as accepted by any other, unless the latter so desired. The basic purpose of the Conference is that the countries concerned should become better acquainted with one another's point of view. The Prime Ministers hoped that this clarification would enable all the invited countries to accept their invitation.10. The Prime Ministers wished to state that in seeking to convene an Asian-African Conference, they were not actuated by any desire for exclusiveness in respect of the membership of the Conference. They did not desire either that the participating countries should build themselves into a regional bloc.11. The Prime Ministers expressed gratification at the results of the Geneva Conference on Indo-China and the cessation of hostilities. They expressed the hope that the Geneva Agreements would be fully respected and implemented by all concerned and that there would be no outside interference which would hinder their successful implementation.12. The Prime Ministers in the context of their well known attitude towards colonialism, took note of the case of West Irian. The Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India and Pakistan supported the position of Indonesia in thismatter. They expressed the earnest hope that the Netherlands Government would reopen negotiations to implement their obligations under the solemn agreements concluded by them with Indonesia.13. The Prime Ministers expressed their continued support of the demand of the peoples of Tunisia and Morocco for their national independence and their legitimate right to self-determination.14. The Prime Ministers reiterated their grave concern in respect of the destructive potential of nuclear and thermonuclear explosions for experimental purposes which threaten not only their countries, but the world, and their far-reaching and yet unascertained effects which may do permanent damage to human life and civilization. They earnestly requested all concerned to bring about a cessation of such experiments. They also requested the Disarmament Commission to take this matter into immediate consideration.15. The economic development of Asian countries, which is so urgently necessary for the happiness and wellbeing of their peoples, requires a planned approach with a view to the utilization, in the most effective manner, of the available resources: An essential pre-requisite of such an approach is full knowledge of these resources. Surveys of physical resources, particularly of the mineral and sub-soil wealth of each country, should therefore be conducted, and cooperation in the supply of technical personnel and in other ways should be made available.16. The Prime Ministers considered that cooperation in the economic sphere for the supply of technical personnel and in all other ways should engage the attention of their Governments. They considered that a committee of experts should be set up to consider economic questions of common interest to their countries.17. The Prime Ministers, meeting on the eve of the New Year, expressed their earnest hope that the year 1955 would witness a further growth in the friendly cooperation of the countries represented in the Conference as well as other countries and further the cause of world peace.",communique,,,,
"The following are highlights of Premier All Sastroamb djojo's answers to the series of questions from H. Gordon, Far Eastern Editor of the I.N.S.:What, in your opinion is the major objective of the Afro-Asian Conference?In my opinion the major objective of the Asian African Conference is what is said in paragraph 4(d) of the Joint Communique of the Bogor Conference, aS follows: ""to view the position of Asia and Africa and their peoples in the world of today and the contribution they can make to the promotion of world peace and cooperation*
However, the three other points of that paragraph should not be considered as unimportant, as they contain issues which are of vital interest for the peoples of Asia and Africa in their relations between each other and the world at large.
Do you expect the Conference to take action on the issue of co-existence ? If so, what?The problem of peaceful co-existence might come up as an item for discussion in the Conference since it not only concerns the peoples of Asia and Africa but also other nations in the world. Whether the Conference will take actions on that issue, I do not yet know.
Is there any fear the Peoples Republic of China will use the Conference simply to strengthen the role of Communism in Asia?There is no such fear from the side of the five sponsoring Colombo countries.
What do you envisage the Conference can do to ease world tensions, particularly those between Moscow and Washington?This question must be viewed in the light of what I have said in answering your first question. What the Conference can do to ease world tensions depends on the outcome of the discussions concerning the position of Asia and Africa and their peoples in the world of today,
What ""common denominators"" can be expected to unify the invited nationsSome of the ""common denominators"" might be the social, economic and cultural problems and relations of the countries represented in the conference since most of the invitees are today facing more or less the same economic situation in their respective countries. Another issue of common interest might be the question of colonialism.
Is the Conference fundamentally a search for political and international solidarity by the non white races of the world?Since most of the invitees are members of the United Nations, it can be said that I will not deviate from the fundamental objective of the United Nations Charter, of which the most important one is international solidarity. I can therefore state here that it is positively not an international solidarity of the ""nonwhite races'' against the ""white races'
Why were the Arab nations invited, but not Israel?Whether a country is to be invited, was decided by the five Prime Ministers unanimously, The invitation to the Arab nations was agreed upon unanimously, whereas there was no unanimity concerning Israel.
Why was Communist China invited, but not Nationalist China?The five sponsoring countries recognize only China, that is the People's Republic of China.
Why were Vietnam and Vietminh invited, but not the Republic Korea?As you know the five Prime Ministers of the sponsoring countries are more or less committed with regard to the issue of IndoChina, since in April 1954 when meeting for the first time in Colombo, they have taken a common stand on the Indo-China problem. The world also knows that the Colombo decision had a considerable influence on the Geneva Conference resulting in the state of affairs prevailing now in Indo-China. Now that our suggestions accepted by the Geneva Conference, we felt a special responsibility by inviting all the Into China a including South Vietnam and Vietminh (North Vietnam).That same reasoning did not apply to Korea
What will prevent the conference from developing into an alignment against the rest of the free world under pro-Communist slogans of anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism?
Anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism are not slogans monopolized by Communists, but are living realities in the minds of the masses of the peoples of Asia and Africa. Unfortunately these sentiments are generally ignored or minimized by the Western world. The presumption that anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism are merely Communist slogans, indicates an ignorance of the psychological impact on the feelings prevailing today among the Asian and African nations which only recently emerged from colonial status into independence. It is therefore wrong to anticipate that the conference will develop into any alignment against or for any bloc in the world.
Will the conference leaders encourage the formation of a ""third force"" in world politicsNo. In their joint Communique after the Bogor Conference the five Prime Ministers stated very clearly that: ""They did not desire either that the participating countries should build themselves into a regional bloc"",
What is your reply to the recent criticism of Secretary John Foster Dulles that the recent five-power communique was a ""somewhat ambiguous document ?""I have no official communication from the Secretary of State Mr. John Föster Dulles concerning his criticism. In my opinion the recent Five Power Communique was a clear document with a clear purpose.",general,,Ali Sastroamidjojo,,
"Afro-Asian meeting
Of the significance of the forthcoming Afro-Asia ference, for which the foundations are being laid by the Colombo Powers at Bogor, there can be no doubt. It is in response to an increasing awareness of common interests and closer bonds among those Afro-Asian Powers which have remained uncommitted to either the Communist before the
States or to the Western bloc. On many issues U.N, in deciding which, it was felt, there was a preponderance of Big Power influence, the smaller States of the Afro-Asian continents have invariably combined to exercise a moderating and restraining influence. To what extent the proposed conference will establish some form of machinerary for mutual consultations en a regular basis if, indeed, specific and formal procedure is considered necessary is a question for the main body of the AfroAsian Conference to decide for itself. The enthusiasm with which the prospects of closer co-operation among the Afro-Asian Power have been received should not blind us to the very real difficulties of forming an organisation which is not a bloc but is at the same time sufficiently cohesive to represent the interests of countries covering

so vast an area as that of the Afro-Asian continents. Clearly, anticolonialism is too negative a platform to provide the sense of contsructive purpose which alone can make the organisation truly effective and acceptable as the spokesman of the Afro-Asian peoples. .....
Much will depend on whether Peking considers itself more Asian than Communist or vice versa. If the AfroAsian Conference accomplishes nothing more than reveal to what extent Communist is willing to co-operate with its Asian neighbours and Arab States, it will be a worthy attempt on behalf of Asian solidarity. Peking will then be given an opportunity to establish its bona fides and if possible confound those sceptisc who feel that, by the fact of being Communist, China is rearer to its fellow Communist States in Europe than to its Asian neighbours with which it has racial and cultural ties.

"Jakarta Conference
In a stirring speech made at a mass meeting at. Jakarta, Prime Minister Mohammed Ali has reiterated the principles of Pakistan's foreign policy in very clear terms. His bold reference to Islam as a living force drew such an applause from the audience that he had to pause several times to let the ovation die down. The fact that Mr. Mohammed Ali is the Prime Minister of an Islamic State has placed him in an enviable position to talk to the people of Indonesia as freely as he would talk to his own people. The spontaneous and overwhelming response that his speech has evoked, brings to the fore the vigour and appeal that Islam commands as a force which can transcend the barriers imposed by geography, language and customs. His performance has indeed earned Pakistan a permanent place in the hearts of the people of Indonesia.When the Prime Minister told the people of Indonesia ""When you fought for your independence, the hearts ef our people and their prayers were with you When you suffered, we suffered too in our hearts"", he was not making
a diplomatic statement, but was expressing the feeling of the people of this country. We have consistently upheld the right of those peoples who are struggling to free themselves form the bondage of colonialism. Our feeling of anxiety is all the more great if the oppressed people happen to be Muslims. In the international conferences Pakistan has not missed a single opportunity to uphold the cause of these peoples. In the independence of Libya, Pakistan played no mean a part. In the last Colombo Conference, it was Pakistan which sponsored the resolution declaring the full fledged support to the liberation movement in French North Africa. Likewise in the Jakarta Conference Pakistan has again succeeded in securing a pledge from the Asian Premiers to continue supporting the North African liberation struggle.Pakistan's stand in the Jakarta Conference regarding the solution of outstanding disputes among the participating countries, has once again placed India in a difficult position, The logic of Pakistan's plea has thwarted the endorsement
Nehru-Chou En-Lai five-point programme which would establish India's leadership over Asia. Though at the instance of Pakistan, the conference has agreed that the proposed Afro-Asian Conference was not aimed at creating regional bloc, India has not completely abandoned the ides and is reported to be busy enlisting support for her plan. The best protection against India's attempts to reduce the conference into an instrument for the enhance-sphere of its participation.Pakistan has already proposed that Turkey should be invited in the proposed conference as she has vital interest in Asia and Africa. With the decision already taken to invite Japan to the conference, there will be a formidable combination against any attempts by any country to dominate the region. The first duty the proposed AfroAsian Conference will be towards itself. If the conference fails to solve those issues which are faced by the nations participating in this conference, it will have forfeited the claim to show the rest of the world the way to peace.(Pakistan Standard, Karachi 1-1-'55).",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"This 'Afro-Asianism'
The meeting at Bogor, Indonesia, of five Asian Prime Ministers, representing the so-called Colombo Powers, has decided to issue invitations to 25 other countries besides the sponsors TO attend a larger conference planned for April this year. If every invitation is accepted, all the independent States of the two continents will gather together four months hence with two exceptions: Israel and the Union of South Africa. Thus, a new international body comprising exclusively the coloured"" races and nations, seems to be taking shape. Whether this further sub-division of mankind is likely to be conducive of good for the world and the human race is problematical. The United Nations, as it exists and functions today, may be far from a perfect institution, but this attempt to create unsatisfactory what may well prove to be an even more united nations"" of Asians and Africans alone is not the answer. Can it not be, that a sort of inferiority complex, magnified to international proportions, underlies the urge
to bring together the yellow, brown and black pigmented peoples in an exclusive organisation of their own ? It may be said that only loose periodical meetings, and no permanent organisation, is at present contemplated, but such moves inevitably lead to the emergence of organisation. According to the communique issued by the ""Colombo Powers"" which term is in itself a misnomer the which will purpose of the larger Afro-Asian meet probably result in the discovery of a new name, the""*Jakarta Powers"", would be""A. To promote goodwill and co-operation between the nations of Asia and Africa, to explore and advance their
mutual as well as their common interests and to establish and further friendliness and neighbourly relations.""B. To consider the social, economic and cultural problems and relations of the countries represented""C. To consider the problems of special interest to Asian and African peoples, e.g. the problems affecting the national sovereignty and of racialism and colonialism;""D. To view the position of Asia and Africa and their peoples in the world of today and the contribution they can make to the promotion of world-peace and cooperation"".
With regard to ""A"", can such meetings alone achieve this object ? A negative answer is suggested by the failure of the first meeting In Colombo to promote ""goodwill and co-operation between, for example, Bharat and Pakistan. In fact, the relationship between these two countries considerably deteriorated after that meeting. As for ""B"", every country in the world has its social and cultural problems, with which it deals in its own way, and in the solution of which there is not much scope fOr practical international co-operation, unless the aim is to exchange and transplant social and cultural characteristics, which would be an absurd proposition. Economic problems, no doubt, provide greater scope for co-operation and mutual help, but In this assistance of the economically advanced and flourishing nations of the rest of the world is needed even more. The cult of Afro Asian exclusiveness that is being fostered is not likely to encourage that assistance. And why under ""C"", does the communique mention only national sovereignty, racialism and colonialism as problems of special interest to Asia and Africa? Such vestiges of colonialism and racialism as still remain and as imply the superiority of or domination by one people over another, must no doubt be ended, but is there no racialism and colonialism inside the Afro-Asian world itself ? Do we not behold across our own frontiers a new racialism of the worst possible type rearing its ugly head, and do we not ourselves possess a neighbour who has many times in recent months attempted to be-little our own national sovereignty And most important of all, are not international goodwill and co-operation, as well 2S peace itself, threatened by the dispute over Kashmir, the people of which territory continue to groan under the yoke of an Asian country ? It is only a pretence for the ""Colombo Powers"" to think that while on the one hand they ignore these internal realities within the ""Afro-Asian"" world, they can, on the other hand, promote ""world peace and co-operation"" by mobilising Asia and Africa against the rest.
Our Prime Minister, Mr. Mohammed Ali, has done well to point out emphatically at Bogor, as he did on the and previous occasion at Colombo, that if such meetings conference are to serve any useful purpose the internal problems of the region, such as disputes between the conferring countries themselves, must be taken cognizance of and dealt with, instead of pretending as if they did not exist.Last but not the least important is the question why the threat of Communism to the countries of Asia and Africa has found no mention at all in the Bogor communique ? In the communique issued after the first conference at Colombo the following important passage was included under the head ""Communism and external interference"" **The subject of Communism in its national and international aspects was discussed. The Prime Ministers declared their unshakable determination to resist interference in the affairs of their countries by external Communist, anti-Communist or other agencies. They were convinced that such interference threatened the sovereignty, security, and political independence of their respectiveStatesHow did it come about at Bogor that in drawing up the aims and objects of the larger Asian-African conference the threat of Communism was wholly forgotten ? If the explanation is that Communist China being one of the new invitees, the mention of Communism was left out so as not to offend the susceptibilities of that country, then it would be a confession of a complete ideological surrender.And finally the vital principle that in such conferences decisions would not be taken by a majority but only on ferring countries themselves, must be taken cognizance of and dealt with, instead of pretending as if they did not exist.Last but not the least important is the question why the threat of Communism to the countries of Asia and Africa has found no mention at all in the Bogor communique ?

The Prime Minister of Ceylon, Sir John Kotelawala made what one must regard as a damaging revelation when he said after the conference: ""You have to abide by the majority's views and decisions at such conferences.* Our own Prime Minister said the same thing in different words when he disclosed that the decision to invite Communist China ""was not unanimous from the start."" In view of this change in the procedure by which decisions are now taken at these conferences, Pakistan, we suggest, should continue to participate in them only if the original principle of no decision by majority is revived and stricly adhered to. And greater resistance should be displayed in future to ""persuasion"" intended to obtain unanimity at the sacrifice of the principles for which Pakistan stands.(Dawn, Karachi2-1-'55).",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"Brown man's burden
The peoples of Africa, on their tortuous path to freedom, look to the peoples living in Asia for spiritual and moral support. They believe that Asia which has but recently been living in subjection will look on their problems sympathetically.Africa is the most glaring example of imperialist exploitation and the continent in which the enslavement of men has reached its most degrading depths. The vestiges of coloniallism survive in other lands, too, and the peoples of Goa, Irian, Malaya, Guiana, and Cyprus are in the melancholy list of those denied the right of self-determination.The conference of the Colombo Powers will lay its plans for a meeting of the Afro-Asian powers to discuss colonialism. It is an encouraging thought that whatever unity exists already among the peoples in this region is built around
a sympathetic concern for the oppressed colonial peoples. Vague though the cohesion of this block is it shows itself, in the United Nations especially, through the Arab Asian group which springs into action as soon as it hears a report of ruthless colonial exploitation or the suppression through force of arms of a people's urge to freedom. So far the anxiety of the Free Asian nations and that of the Arab powers who, too, will take part in the AfroAsian conference, has been excited mostly when the simmering unrest of the colonial peoples has erupted in violence. They need now to be vigilant on the normal conduct of colonial affairs to see how the transfer of power to indigenous peoples may be accelerated.
The colonial powers, it is true, have defined their aims as the progressive realisation of self-government. Sometimes the formula is varied to one of ""partnership"", All these are invariably unctuous terms intended to soften the harsh fact of ruling land and exploiting its resources primarily for the benefit of its White overlords.
To the microscopic minority of White settlers ""progressive realisation of self-government"" means a convenient process by which they will continue to dominate large colored majorities, and they, their sons and their sons' sons will enjoy the exclusive privileges they have arbitrarily created for themselves.And ""partnership"", as a survey made in this issue of Jana indicates is understood by the dominant White group to be an arrangement in which they take the profits and the coloured races all the risks.Unless the Colombo powers, and later the Afro-Asian group, mean merely to pass a platitudinous resolution saying they abhor colonialism they must exert themselves to see how their solicitude for the freedom of the colonial peoples can be translated into fruitful action.
There is much they can do immediately to achieve peacefully a transfer of power.Those Colombo Powers for instance, who are members of the British Commonwealth could exert their friendly persuasion on Britain as the single largest colonial power to speed up the pace at which power is being transferred to the nationals of a country. A similar attitude may be induced in the other colonial powers through the agencies of the United Nations.
In the concept of ""trusteeship"" the nations of the world have acknowledged that others besides the colonial powers may take an interest in the welfare of the colonial peoples. It is irrelevant to dismiss such concern as interference in the domestic affairs of a nation. But *trusteeship"" as it is now operated by the UN is generally ineffective.
The Colombo Powers should note, too, that the patterns of political suppression have increased. While the imperial domains of the European Powers are shrinking, a new slavery has arisen in the rule of Soviet Communism arbitrarily imposed through the force of the Red Army on the countries of Eastern Europe. The Free Asian Nations of civil liberties cannot be indifferent to the suppression and human rights in the satellite states of Sovietised Europe.Action which will bring freedom to all the oppressed peoples, however, is not full measure of the obligations which the Free Asian nations must assume towards the colonial peoples.
The transfer of power, for instance, will create now problems of administration. In the African regions and in her onionial was either through a deliberate policy of the rulers or as result of the cultural backwardness of some of its peoples skilled indigenous administrators are scarce. The Asian nations which have developed their own häministrative skills can assist the peoples of the colonies to develop these talents.Whether they are the inhabitants of the older colonies or of the new Soviet imperialisms they have a similar problem of under-developed economies. The Free Asian nations which are themselves struggling to overcome the difficulties inherent economies can pass the experience they aou colonial peoples as they emerge into freedom.The brown man, 100, has a burden to carry in a world where insecurity and unrest in one regi threatens the peace and stability of all.(Jana, Colomba January, 1955)",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"""Neutral strip""The mere fact that the proposal for a neutral peace, from Egypt to the Philippines, which is to be the purpose of the Afrasian Conference contemplated by the C-Power promiers, has the endorsement of Red China should make it suspect to all men of decent minds. Peace is indivisible. It must be global in concept and implementation, or it is not peace. If the moving spirits behind the Afrasian Conference, as projected, think that they can enclose the region between Egypt and the Philippines in a sort of verbal barbed-wire stockade through which war with its terrors, however it may rage outside, will never penetrate, then they are deluding themselves and all who follow them most sadly and most stupidly.

"Turn to the wheel

Decisions by the ""Colombo Premiers' are of deep significance to Australia and the Western world. Their invitation to 25 nations, including Communist China, but excluding all Western countries, to a conference in April, could be the beginning of an upsurge of racial hatreds against the West, The decision to support Indonesia in itS claim for sovereignty over West New Guinea though not unexpected, should show Australians where the sympathies of most of their near neighbours lie.

The Colombo Premiers were insistent that their sole object in calling the conference of Asian and African countries was to promote understanding. But another note was sounded when the Premier of Ceylon said he saw no reason for inviting South Africa to join. The reason given for the omission was, ""We are not allowed there, so why should we ask them here*?
There is no suggestion that Communist influence has dictated the decisions, but they are in the Communist tradition and undoubtedly play into the hands of Communis propagandists.
Australia and the Western world desire and need the friendship of these nations. The West is showing its good faith ina practical way through the Colombo plan, which has already given all the ""Colombo Premiers"" help and will give more.

"Afro-Asian Talks in Indonesia The Afro-Asian conference which is to meet almost certainly at Bandung at the end of April is to have the widest possible representation. and no less wide opportunities in drawing up its own agenda. A statement issued to-night at the close of the meeting at Bogor of the five Prime Ministers of the Colombo Powers invite: says that the joint sponsors of the conference are to Afghanistan, Cambodia, etc.

The long statement issued emphasizes in phrase after uncommittedphrase the general get togetherness""and ness of the proposed conference. Co-operation, mutual interest, cultural relations, economic relations, the promotion of peace these are the recurring phrases, and if colonialism, something more precise, like racialism and can be picked out, it is hardly surprising. The only conclusion can be that with such a heterogeneous collection of guests what comes out of it will depend on what is put into it, and as the task of drawing up the agenda has been left tO conference itself there is little to go on.

Getting Acquainted. will
Those to be invited are assured that their presence involve DO commitments or any change in their attitude to other participating States and that there is no intention

of changing forms of government or ways of life. The sponsors are motivated by no desire for exclusiveness, and have no intention of forming regional blocs. The basic purpose is to become better acquainted with one another and with one another's points of view.

What some of these points of view may be is revealed
The visiting in some other paragraphs of the statement.
Prime Ministers took note of the Indonesian position on Western New Guinea and gave it their support; they supported nationalist demands in Tunisia and Morocco unofficial representatives of which have been buzzing expressed around the fringes of the Bogor meeting grave concern at thermonuclear experiments, and hoped that the Geneva agreement would be fully respected, with that no outside interference. They concluded by hoping 1955 would be a year of friendly co-operation.

The statement admits, however, that much of the interest of the conference will revolve round the inclusion of
China. Clearly, if tension is to be eased or the blocs brought closer together, the Colombo Colombo Powers are are best equipped to it. There was, however, some opposition to the inclusion of China from Pakistan and Ceylon. But the recent visit of Mr. Nehru and U NU to that country and, it is reliably reported, the assurance given to U NUin Peking that China would welcome an invitation were sufficient to turn the scales.

As to the inclusion of Japan the opposition came from Indonesia, but was evidently not pressed. Obviously Japan is anxious to find her way back to the Asian scene politically as well as economically, and the new Government in Tokyo may find the invitation most timely. Support for Japan seems to have come particularly from the Burmese Prime Minister, if one may judge from remarks he made when addressing school children that morning of December 29, 1945, when they gave a concert as an entertainment to the Prime Ministers before the conference began. He quoted Japan as an instance of an Asian country which was not very rich materially, but whose strength lay in her sons and daughters,-whose loyalty had contributed to making Japan a first-class Power.

It was again U NU and Mr. Nehru who drew the attention of the conference to Viet Nam, Laos, and Cambodia. Both Prime Ministers have passed that way lately, and Mr. Nehru has ample information at his disposal from the Indian staff of the international commissions in all three countries. Obviously this is an area which the Colombo Powers are interested in watching.
The Indian and Burmese Prime Ministers also gave some account of their impressions of China, and seem to have given a favourable verdict on that country as co-operative and peace-loving.

There is a feeling that the proposed conference will be rather too vague and purposeless, not to say heterogeneous, if all those invited accept, Perhaps the whole thing has been left vague lest any feeling of failure should cloud the participants if precise goals were aimed at.

"In April the A-A Conference on the Island of Java
The conference of the five Prime Ministers of the ""'Colombo group as INDIA, PAKISTAN, CEYLON, INDONESIA and BURMA have been called started in an atmosphere of great cordiality at Bogor, Indonesia's summer capital The five Premiers, Nehru, Sastroamidjojo, Mohammad Ali, U NU and Kotelawala had a thorough exchange of viewpoints regarding the arguments which have to be discussed by the conference and regarding the countries which will be invited to participate. There should not be any disagreements about the first point, because the conference will examine suitable means for a relaxation of tension in Asia as well as in the rest of the world, and all agree on this point, Disagreements might arise regarding the invitations to be sent to some countries, first of all to the People's Republic of China and secondly to Israel.

Regarding the latter, the opposition comes from the
Arab countries which lately assumed an increasingly rigid attitude towards the Tel-Aviv government and which miss no chance to isolate the Jewish State more and more.

The question of the invitation of China is more complicated. India, Burma and Indonesia are favourably inclined towards including the Peking government among those due to be permitted to participate in the conference, while Pakistan and Ceylon though they have not assumed 3 contrary attitude are rather reserved and diffident on this issue. It is feared that the presence of the Chinese delegates might induce some of the Asian countries, such as the Philippines and Siam, which have not recognized the Peking government, to desert the conference. In fact, there are-already rumours according to which America is bearing pressure to induce these two countries to assume a similar attitude.
In this connection we must recall that Siam and the Philippines belong to SEATO, whose function is decidedly anti-Chinese, and therefore it is, apparently; being consi dered that their presence at the same conference table with the People's Republic of China would be rather anachronistic.

These arguments are, howèver, being rejected by Nehru and U NU, who pointed out that, above all, the people's Republic of China is fully authorized to participate in said conference in so far as she has fully recognized and approved the famous ""five points"" of the Colombo plan, which represent the foundation of solidarity and friendship among the Asian nations. After all, the Bandung conference is not supposed to produce the formation of a political and military Afro-Asian bloc, but should only serve the purpose of discussing and approving some fundamental principles which might be the same ""five points"" of Colombo insofar as they could serve as a presupposition and guiding principle for the relations between the two continents.

The importance of next April's conference, the foundations of which were laid last May during the meeting of the five Premiers at Colombo, can easily be evaluated if we consider the fundamental part played by the Asian countries and particulary by India during the last year. It is sufficient to recall the happy results achieved by the Geneva conference for peace in Indochina, the success of which was greatly due to India's acting as intermediary. The task of the next Bandung conference in which some countries will participate will be the unification of the forces of the Afro-Asian countries; for the realization of peace policies and the creation of an area of security and stability in that vast part of the world. It would be absurd to exclude China from the number of the invited powers. (Avanti, Italy 29-12-'54).",press,,,Europe,

"Today and Tomorrow (By Walter Lippmann)
As the old year was coming to an end, there became visible something of the shape of things to come. I know that in a venture of this sort we are all of us like the blind men in the fable who were trying to describe the-shape of the elephant from what they could learn by touching it But there have been three stories in the past three weeks which, that we put together, foretell something big and important shall be running into.

One is the crisis of indecision in the French Parliament in the world. The on the role of France in Europe and heart of this crisis has been that the democratic Assembly is so divided in its aims and so contradictory in its views that it cannot render a firm judgment about the vital interests of France. This malady of the French democracy iS not confined to France. Our own Congress, for and confusion example, is in a similar state of deadlock over our policy in the Far East. The members of Congress are so divided within their own mind, they are so committed by the many statements and speeches they have made, that they cannot go beyond saying no to those who want to make war and no to those who do not.

But the German problem is chosen the connot a sufficient explanation of why Peking has also this time to increase the tension by such acts as

American support from counter-revolution in China. Yet Peking chose that moment to exacerbate the relations not only with the United States but with the European nations who fought with the United States in Korea.

The third big story at the year's end is probably the biggest of all. It is the decision at Jakarta by the Prime of Pakistan
Ministers of the Colombo powers, that is to say India, Burma, Ceylon and Indonesia, to call a conference in April of the thirty ""independent governments"" of Asia and Africa. The more closely onc reads the text of this historic communique, the plainer it is that we and our afford leading European allies are not going to be able to the luxury of parliamentary confusion and delay which and firm prevents our governments from making clear decisions in Asia and in Africa. The fixing of April as a date for the meeting of the Asian-African conference is in effect the setting of a kind of deadline for a great many issues, such as Formosa, and perhaps North Africa as well which will have to be much more clearly dealt with than they are now.

Let us have no illusions about the fact that the United
States and its leading allies in Western Europe are going to be the judged and not the judges at this April conference. The official communique all but says inso many words that the conference will consider our intentions. in Formosa Africa and and Korea, the French intentions in North in New Guinea, South Viet Nam, the Netherlands position the British in such places as Cyprus.

The list of the non-invited countries is interesting. Among the countries which are in Asia as a matter of geography, the non-invited are the Soviet Union, Australia and New Zealand, North and South Korea, Nationalist China and of
Israel. There appear to have been two main criteria non-admission. One is to be now a satellite or colony of criterion is not to the West. Formosa and Korea are not to be treated as ""independent governments"". The second be of Asian stock, as the Soviet Union, Australia and New
Zealand are not. evident that this is no mere attempt to make a neutral The list of the states they did not invite makes it very bloc or a third force in between the giant military powers. Red China is no neutral and no third force. What this is to put it plainly, is the most formidable and ambitious

move yet made In this generation to apply the principle of Asia for the Asians.
The members of this conference are to include all the great Asian powers foremost among them India, Pakistan, Japan and China. The conference intends to promote economic, social and cultural cooperation. But the least common denominator among the members the sentiment which unites them most easily, is their alignment on what the communique describes as ""problems affecting national sovereignty and of racialism and of colonialism. The United States and its allies are going to be put on the defensive, and they had better not lose much time seeing to it that the positions they are going to defend are in fact defensible.

So far as we are concerned. Formosa is the place of greatest vulnerability. It is vulnerable not perhaps because there is danger of war but because of the danger of our finding ourselves isolated from and at odds with the massive sentiment of rican position in all of Asia. In point of fact the Amerational and, therefore, Formosa is by way of becoming more more intelligible and defensible.
But this is being done surreptitiously, indeed it appears that it is being done by the dubious device of secret clauses attached to open treaties. The reason for this iS not wholly face but mainly because Congress iS supposed to be unwilling to up to a rational and workable decision.
In Washington, in Paris, and In some degree in all the

democratic capitals, the question is whether the elected assemblies will support those revisions of judgment and those decisions of policy which are called for by the swift march of world events.

"A conference on a grand scale
There is an element of unreality about the ""AfricanAsian"" conference which the five Colombo power Premiers propose to hold next April. These five statesmen representing India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Burma and Indonesia have themselves a fair amount of subjects to discuss which they hold in common. The conference they now propose to hold will have no binding quality.

Offhand, indeed, it is possible to think of only two common qualities. One is that all the nations involved are non-white. The other is that all of them have emerged, or are emerging, from some form of subject or inferior states. As that status was imposed in all cases by the white peoples of the western world, they all hold strong views on the subject of colonialism which, it is expected, will bulk largely on the proposed conference's agenda. What makes for the conference's unreality is, however, the fact that the practical issues that now face this substantial group Some of them indeed of powers are now by no means the same. are barely on speaking terms, and distrust their neighbours deeply. An example of this is

ho be found in the fact that no invitation will be sent Israel. Israel were invited, so the argument runs, the Moslem powers would not attend. Israel of course belongs at such a conference as much as any of the others. Israck when Palestine was a British mandate, learned much about ""colonialism"" in broad sense. But the common bond which exists among all of them because of colonialism is overlooked in Israel's case because Israel's neighbours are virtually in a state of war with it Similar difficulties exist in the case of India and Pakistan which. in 1947, partitioned the Indian sub-continent between them and have since fallen out violently over the major boundary dispute involved in the future of Kashmir. There are also reports that, if Red China is invited some of the sponsoring powers won't even turn up There is fear in Asia over China's ambitions, and that fear grows stronger as the feeling of Asiatic identity loses its original driving force.

It seems likely then that the conference, if and when takes place, will spend its time drawing up resounding declarations of broad general principles. The text of each resolution will be carefully combed to make sure it does not interfere with complete freedom of action of each nation represented. They will be against the old colonial order of things They will be for nationalism and independence. They will also probably declare that the big world power struggle with its poles in Washington and Moscow is something to stay out of.

India is prepared to give ""peaceful co-existence"" with Communist China chance, and no one could do more than Prime Minister Nebru has done to establish good relations with Peking.

the policy of anti-Communist alliance, considers passive co-existence inadequate, and favors active friendship toward all other powers.
This policy ought, as a matter of fact, to commend itself to those powers that regard themselves as predominantly Christian.

"Warning and challenge

momentous conference, the like of which has not been seen on earth before, is to take place next April in the Indonesian mountain city of Bandung. If all the invitatons are accepted, thirty Asian and African countries, inhabited by half of mankind, will be represented. The meeting will offer a warning and.a challenge to the other half of the human race, and especially to-the nations of the
Commonwealth.
The list of people bidden to Bandung is unique in two respects. brings together Asian and. African leaders unaccustomed to exchanging ideas except in the United Nations Assembly: and it brings together the spokesmen of states at different stages of political development, unaccustomedto meeting anywhere. There are sovereign nations on the list Turkey, Egypt and Japan among them. There are communities still under some form of tutelage or external control. shaky though it may be the Gold Coast, the Sudan, the Indo-China states and others.

What can bind these scattered countries together ? What is the common interest of Red China and Ethiopia, of the Philippines and Lebanon, to name four more of the invited? The answer is plain. These Asian and African states, with few exceptions, recently were or still are dependencies. With no exception whatever, they have a lower standard of living, measuring welfare by thedistribution of material of course, goods, than is enjoyed in other continents. This, to Bandung is obvious. What is significant about the call is that the common plight of Asians and Africans has been recognized and proclaimed in Asia.
It is true that the invitation to the Conference does not speak directly of grievances. The five inviting countries India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma and Indonesia refrained from suggesting an Afro-Asian bloc with revolutionary aims. Their objectives, however, are plain on the agenda they have proposed. Colonialism, racialism and economic problems are to be discussed. Bids to the Red regimes in China and Northern Vietnam are an acknowledgment of communism as a factor in Asia's upheaval.

South Africa, headquarters of discrimination against the Negro, has been pointedly excluded from the list of guests. Any working combination of African and Asian peoples to banish Western influence from their two continents may and be a genciation away. Seething discontent in Africa Asia is a current fact and Bandung may prove to be a rallying point. The fortunate nations of the carth have much to offer to the discontented in their search for liberty

and well-being. They can offer political education, economic help and, above all, friendship.

"AFRO-ASIAN CONFAB
The proposed conference has been the talk of the world for the principal reason that it is the first of its kind in displaying political solidarity between the Asian and African countries, great land masses which are the home of half of the world population. What would greatly enthuse and hearten the promoters of this conference, especially the host country of Indonesia, is the fact that it has generally received a most favourable reaction in the world press.

From the Soviet bloc journals, praise for the projected Afro-Asian conference sounds unqualified and unequivocal. Said the Polish newspaper ""Trybuna Lubu"": ""During the past few years no other continent has seen so much stormy development and experienced so many major political changes in Asia. Among these changes are the victorious revolution in China, the independence achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle for national liberation, the birth of friendly relations among new Asian states irrespective of their social system, the determined stand taken by Asian countries against colonialism and isolation of the imperialist puppets. The resolutions of the Bogor conference reflect the great changes that are taking place in the world, particularly Asia"". The ""Szabab Nep"", organ of the Hungarian Working People's Party, comments that the conference will be an important factor in easing international tension. Similar sentiments were also the keynote of the ""Nhandan"", organ of the Vietnam Lao Dong Party. So much for the opinions of one side.

The attitude of the Western Powers to the conference is one of caution and curiosity. Western Governments have not publicized their view on the topic; but Western observers are busy judging the possiblities that may arise out of the Afro-Asian conference generally by examining the character of its would-be participants. Some of them, indeed, belittle the importance and value of the conference. Still the popular American political writer Walter Lippman frankly upheld that the communique issued at the Bogor meeting was a warning signal to the West to be more realistic and less vacillating in their policies concerning Africa

and Asia. The opening date of the Afro-Asian conference, in his opinion, ""sets the deadline for a great many issues, such as Formosa and perhaps North Africa as well."" He considers that the Afro-Asian conference will be the judgment day by the East of the Western Powers who ""are going to find themselves at odds with massive sentiments of Asia."" He calls for a revision of policies on the East by the Western Powers in time.

The Afro-Asian conference is decidedly of vital necessity from the standpoint of many countries who have agreed to lend their participation. The least value it canhave is to be the true forum of Afro-Asian opinion which does not always find its proper outlet in the United Nations and other world councils where Western political sway is indisputably in evidence. Yet the swift changes of world politics have affected these Afro-Asian nations in the last decade more than they have experienced before. They do want to help relax international tension, further the principles of co-existence, halt imperialism and promote prospects of world peace. And they want to do it in a manner most natural and suitable for them. The decisions and programme adopted at the Afro-Asian conference will also form the guiding principle of the foreign policies of the majority of the governments in two continents.

"AMERICA ENCOURAGES HER ALLIES IN THE ASIAN-AFRICAN CONFERENCE
Some of the Diplomatic Representatives of the States Allied to America which have been invited to attend the Bandung Conference stated today that America is encouraging her allies among the Asian and Middle Eastern States to participate in the Asian-African Conference to be held in Indonesia in April next for fear lest the Chinese Communists and ""Neutrals"" spread their influences on the two Conferences.

These diplomatists assert that the Philippines, Siam and Japan have accepted the invitation to the Conference after it had discussed the matter from all viewpoints with the American responsible authorities, and they are inclined to the beliefs that Turkey which had no intention first to attend the Conference has subsequently accepted the invitation as a result of the encouragement it received from the American authorities.

American Government attitude Responsible authorities in Washington declare that Pakistan, one of the five Colombo States which have sponsored the Bandung Conference is considered among the States friendly to America and can be relied upon to resist Communist and neutral pressure. The United States attitude towards the conference can be summed up in refrainment from all comment on the arrangements which are the being made for its convocation or from pressure on States to take part therein so long as it has not been invited to attend. Yet Diplomatic Circles in Washington assert non official that responsible Americans in the course of conversations with the representatives of the Middle Eastern and Asian States friendly to America that WasConference hington looks forward to their attending the and expressing their views on the questions under discussion.

American Proposals The American authorities stressed the following points of to the Course of their talks with the representatives the Philippines, Siam, Japan and other States opposed to

Communism who are among these invited to Bandung
Conference:
1. A delegation should be selected from among the representatives of these powers efficient and intelligent enough to know what is going on and to express with clarity and force its view points.
2. The delegation of States opposed to communism should be prepared to refute communist arguments aiming at winning the sympathy of neutrals among the representatives of the Asia-African States.
3. Preparations to submit practical proposals for cultural and economical cooperation among the States represented at Bandung. Such cooperation would render an invaluable service to the Asia-African cause.

Japan and her neighbour The American officials, consider that the Asian African Conference will give a good opportunity for Japan to reconnect her friendly relations with her Asian neighbours who cut relations with her ever since last war.
The American's point of view which was declared to Asian diplomats are that America fears that Communists China will use the Bandung Conference for propaganda purposes. The Americans say that the conference will be a great benefit if the member States avoid criticising the western camp and try only to design a practical policy for the development of their own countries.

"THE SOLUTION
In consideration of the fact that the Indonesian government, through an authorized spokesman, has virtually vetoed the appointment of Ambassador Romulo as chief of the Philippine delegation to the Afrasian conference at Bandung in April, the government is faced with a delicate problem in protocol.
The Indonesians and their co-sponsors insist that the chief delegates be either prime ministers or foreign ministers of the governments concerned. Now it is clearly out of the question for the President of the Philippines to head such a delegation. In the first place he has too much to do at home, and in the second place the conference, however important it may seem to its sponsors, is hardly of sufficient importance to require the presence of a chief of state. And in our system, fortunately, we are not burdened with a prime minister who holds office at the pleasure of a constantly shifting ""majority"" in the legislature.

The position held by the foreign secretary, who is also the vice-president, is also such as to preclude his being drafted for the mission.
There remains, then, a choice among the among the diplomaticallyqualified men in and out of the government, and of these Ambassador Romulo clearly is the best choice

If protocol at Bandung operates against his appointment in his present official position, the President need only to appoint him minister without portfolio to give him the rank required by the protocol-minded-sponsors of the
Conference. will have Considering that the Chinese communist regime a good deal to say, the Philippines clearly needs to be represented by the one Asian diplomat who has been able to stand up to the communists in a much wider arena than the Conference hall at Bandung and to make the communists back down.

"JAPAN SHOULD ATTEND A-A CONFERENCE

The holding of the A-A Conference was decided at the Southeast Asian 5-Premier Conference held at Bogor ID Indonesia at the end of last year. The common objective is said to investigate the joint interest to the AfroAsian countries and to reciprocally increase the goodneighbor and friendship relations of each other. The invitation letters were dispatched to 25 Afro-Asian countries including Japan and Red China. The session is for around a week beginning from April 18. The place for the Conference is decided to-be Bandung. A formal invitation of Premier Sastroamidjojo of Indonesia representing the inviting countries was received by Premier Hatoyama recently. Japan nOW faces the fortheoming general election. As was stated by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, whether er not Japan presents herself to this Conference should be ultimately decided upon by the new Administration which will come out after the general elections; however, whatever Cabinet is to appear, Japan should attend the Conference. Japan, which has been called the orphan of Asia for 10 years after the war, should not denounce the best

break to utterance attending the Asian country-held Conference. Japan should neither be reserved nor be hesitant to accept the chance, but should dispatch her representative willingly to the prospective Conference.
Undoubtedly, in order to attend the Afro-Asian Conference, Japan has to make various preparations. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu may have included the above when he had talked of Japan's preparation to attend the
Conference.
Firstly, West European Powers including the U.S., the U.K: and France, has some doubts to the character of the Afro-Asian Conference from the right beginning. It may be-that the Conference is said to introduce on the agenda of the Conference the issues of national sovereignty, racialism, colonialism, etc., as ones common to the attending Afro-Asian Countries.

Secondly, included among the invited countries are Japan and Red China; however, the neighboring countries R.O.K. and Nationalist China (Taiwan) are excluded out of the make-up, and the so-called Colombo countries are made nucleus of the Conference. Whether or not the countries like the Thailand and the Philippines which are membered among the Free Nation camp will absent themselves from the Conference is not clear yet. However, as long as the Leftist Socialist Party does not organize the new Cabinet, Japan will naturally attend to the Conference on the standpoint of the Free Nations. Japan's insistence must be definitely clear toward the Communist countries and peace area countries. In order to understand the reciprocal viewpoints of the countries concerned as has been made the fundamental objectives of the Conference, the above mentioned is after all inevitable.

Quite understandably the question as to which countries should take part in this Conference interested broad sections of the public in different countries even before the meeting with the object of dividing the countries of Asia and Africa in Bogor was held. The point is that aggressive US circles, pressure on and counterposing them one to the other, have intensified particularly, to object to the to refuse to participate in the proposed individual governments, seeking to compel them
Conference and.
Republic of China. The US-manufactured bogey of the SOparticipation of the People's called ""Communist menace"" has once again loomed up on

the horizon. The intrigues of American diplomacy have, however, fallen through. Broad sections of the public in Asian and African countries have resolutely stood up for the participation of the People's Republic of China in the
Conference, seeing in this the guarantee for the success of the Conference.
“The basic purpose of the Conference"", reads the statement, ""IS that the countries concerned should become better acquainted with one another's point of view""
The Prime Ministers expressed the hope that the Geneva agreements on Indo-China would be fully respected and implemented by all the countries concerned. At the same time they again expressed their great concern over the A and H-bomb experiments.

The many comments in the press of various countries are evidence of the fact that broad public circles in the countries of Asia and Africa warmly support the decision of the Bogor meeting. In a leading article commenting on the outcome of the meeting the newspaper Kuangmingjihpao writes that Chinese people sincerely welcome the decision to call a Conference of Asian and African countries. It notes that fundamental changes have taken place in the Asia and Africa of to day and that the time has passed when foreigners could arbitrarily dispose of the destinies of the peoples of the East. Now, the paper writes, the peoples of Asia and Africa have enough strength to decide their fate themselves. The countries of Asia and Africa are uniting in the name of peace and close co-operation.
 Touching on the hostile attitude towards the Bandung Conference on the part of the ruling circles of the Western imperialist countries, particularly by US ruling circles, the newspaper points out that the aggressive bloc headed by USA intends to frustrate this Conference. That is why the peoples of Asia and Africa must enhance their vigilance. The results of the Bogor meeting are being widely discussed in the Indian press. The influential Indian newspaper Hindustan Times stated recently that the forthcoming Conference will open up the opportunity for the combined efforts by the countries of Asia and Africa for maintaining peace throughout the world.
The Indonesian newspaper Harian Rakjat, also points out that the question of strengthening peace can be satisfactorily solved if the co-operation of the countries of Asia and Africa is based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence.

The news of the convocation of a Conference in Bandung met with quite a different reception in Washington and London. The advocates of colonial oppression and the enemies of peace were embarrassed by the news that the countries of Asia and Africa have decided, independently, without the ""help"" of the USA and the West European countries, to meet in a Conference. The imperialist politicians are particularly put out by the fact that the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Viet Nam have been invited to the Conference. China, who has been refused admission to UNO, indignantly declares a United

Press correspondent, now receives an invitation to a Conference of first-rate international importance And the forthcoming Conference would stimulate the national liberationmovement in Africa.
Most candid on Washington's and London's fears was
Lippman, New York Herald Tribune commentator, who wrote on January 4: ""Let us have no illusions about the fact that the United States and its leading allies in Western Europe are going to be the judged and not the judges at this April Conference.""

Endeavouring to weaken the general upsurge of the national liberation movement in the Asian and African countries and to scare off individual states from participating in the Conference at Bandung, the USA have already taken a series of ""counter measures."" One of these is the US decision to hold a Conference of SEATO members in Bangkok, capital of Thailand, in February. With the same object in view, Admiral Radford made a tour of American war bases on the territories of certain Asian countries. He has already visited Pakistan, Thailand, South Viet Nam, Japan and the Philippines. The measures adopted by the U.S.A. have, however, the peoples of Asia and Africa are retaliating to the provocative activities of the American brass hats and diplomats by stepping up the fight against colonial independence.
The vital interests of the Asian and African countries urgently demand a policy of co-operation and peaceful co-existence of states and peoples ofthese continents, irrespective of their socio-economic systems.

"""PEKING IN THE LIMELIGHT""
Nehru, as leader of a nation of about 400 millions, has a very great authority among Oriental politicians who stand more or less outside the Great Power bloc, and his responsibility is therefore greater. Although the initiative of the rather curious African-Asian Conference came from Indonesia, it would not have been possible at all without the support of New Delhi. Besides the five inviting, so-called Colombo states, twenty-five others are to take part, from the Philippines and Japan in the East, to the Gold Coast in the West. The names of the uninvited states are almost more interesting than those invited. Although this is not supposed to be a ""coloured"" Conference, the Union of South Africa and Israel are both excluded, as are the Formosa Government and both South and North Korea, while Communist China, South and North Vietnam as well as Laos and Cambodia are all included in the invitation. Formosa has been omitted be-

cause, it is said, all the invited states recognize Communist China, and Chiang Kai-shek does not represent any country a statement that has aroused some query, at least in the case of Ceylon. Even more remarkable is the curious differentiation between Korea and Vietnam.

The programme of the Conference, which is to begin in
April in Indonesia, at Bandung, is extremely vague. The main thing is apparently that the 30 states should get to know one another's opinions; such problems of common interest as the racial question and ""colonialism' are also to be discussed. The spirit in which the conference is to meet states with is illustrated by the fact that the invited the exception of Pakistan and Ceylon who are noticeably reserved gave their support to Indonesia's claim to Dutch Western New Guinea, and to the North African nationalists.
A vote of disapproval of hydrogen bomb experiments
Was also taken, and hopes were expressed that the Geneva agreement on Vietnam will be fulfilled without interference from outside hopes that are likely to be realised, since communist infiltration from within is already SO effective as to influence well in advance the public elections which are to take place in 1956.

Inevitably in these circumstances China is bound to play a leading part, and it is also clear that she will make the most of every chance of increasing dissension between the Western Powers themselves, and between them and other lesser Asian and African states.
It is understandable that the West should not welcome this mammoth conference with great enthusiasm. The Western Powers are well aware of their unfavourable position when it comes to psychological warfare in many of the Asian and African countries, and that much can happen before their plans of economic aid to these countries can be fully realised and have effect. The signatories of the Southeast Asian Security pact, which was a result of the setback in Indo-China, are however, expected to meet in Bangkok on February 23, in order to ""put teeth into"" the pact as it was expressed. But mere military measures at this stage cannot have much effect upon the Chinese and Asian ""neutral"" offensive. It is border-line cases such as these, where political undermining from within is hard to differentiate from armed external action-that are the greatest and most immediate problems facing the Western Powers

"BANGKOK AND BANDUNG SEATO is standing for the South East Asian defence organization.

conferences is quite different.
The purpose of the two The SEATO-conference one might perhaps say contrary. shall organize the resistance against the Communism, the
Asian-African conference is to mark the self assertion of the coloured world towards the white, which spotted by its imperialistic past. The message of the conference will be neutrality, but many of the representatives evidently mean that the Russians are not quite as white as Britains and
Americans.
A comparison between these conferences clearly shows the weakness of SEATO. The purpose is the defense of South East Asia, but the support from the peoples which are going to be defended is very fragile. Thailand and the Philippines are no replacement for India and Indonesia. From the Asian SEATO-members, only Pakistan means something. Even if Head Ouarters is decided to be established in Bangkok, the decision will be made as far away as in Washington, London, Paris and Canberra.

SEATO therefore cannot become an Asian NATO. There would be a small sense in establishing a common Head Command, because there are no forces of any importance to command. The obligations to grant each other help, are also looser formed than in the Atlantic Pact.
The need for establishing a defense against a Communist expansion South from China is a quite real one, but many are after all placing an interrogation at the value of SEATO. It is undoubtedly meaning a nerver to exposed countries like Siam and the non-Communist Indo-China, but this has to be counterbalanced to the hostile reaction among other Asian peoples, which look upon it as a new form of white imperialism. These are two opposing regards which both are heavy, and which in the present situation cannot be united.

"ASIA: CAN THE WEST HOLD BACK THE TIDE ?
""Everybody knows what must come to pass between Asia and the West, the yellow race and the white.. It is imbecile folly for us to close our eyes to the inevitable All the world understands that the gravest crisis in the destiny of the earth's population is at hand.""
Western statesmen last week unhappily recalled these words of Kaiser Wilhelm 1I, popularizer of the phrase ""Yellow Peril"". They could reflect that the onetime German emperor was right as rain and wrong as sin, He was right in foreseeing a crisis that now threatens in an even more virulent form than he envisaged an AfroAsian combination turned by Communism against the West. He was wrong in thinking that the problem was to fight this combination. The problem, according to those who have to deal with it today and tomorrow, is to prevent

its formation. That would be the burden of two conferences during the coming months that can shape the destiny of the world:
Bangkok: The Manila-pact powers (U.S., Britain, France, Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand) have agreed to meet on February 23 in Thailand's canal-coursed metropolis. Whatever their race, these nations of the East and West were resolved to implement their ""Monroe Doctrine Against Communism."" Moscow fumed that the U.S. was seeking ""the more speedy unleashing of military adventures.' Bandung: The Colombo powers (India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma and Indonesia) convoked an unprecedented conference of officials from 30 Asian and African nations, representing more than half of the world's people, for late April in this volcano-ringed Javanese city. The sponsoring powers seemed to be aiming at a sort of Monroe Doctrine Against Colonialism. Their basic philosophy was that the Asian and African nations have some common destiny, freeing them from the Atlantic and the Soviet blocs.

As if to counter this notion, Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden revealed in London that, after attending the Bangkok meeting, he would make his first tour of

southern Asian capitals. By visiting New Delhi, Karachi, and other cities, as John Foster Dulles did soon after taking over as Secretary of State, Eden would dissipate some of the Commonwealth grumbling against London's supposed preoccupation with European matters.
Significance: Western diplomats recognize a serious challenge in the coming Afro-Asian conference. Should Washington and London advise their Asian and African allies to boycot the conference? Or should they urge their allies to participate in the hope of counterbalancing the powerful Communist and neutralist influences which will be at work?

Washington Discussion: In Washington, the question is now being discussed on the highest levels and may reach the National Security Council for decision. Walter S. Robertson, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, leads those who favor a boycott. They contend its influence. They believe that any encouragement given participation will embroil the State Department with Nationalist China (not invited to Bandung) and Chiang Kaishek's champions in Congress.
Those who oppose this view, including Secretary Dulles, claim that the pro-Western nations among the Afro-Asians,

including the Turks, Thais, Filipinos, and Japanese, have sufficient strength and talent to neutralize or at least dim influence at
Chou En-lai's and even Jawaharlal Nehru's Bandung. They fear that a pro-Western boycott will give the Communists a walkover victory and will arouse charges them of colonialism and sabotage against the U.S. Some of look hopefully to Egypt's ambitious undertaking to line up at least a dozen countries in favor of weaning India and Indonesia away from Red influences and of barring new recognition of the Peking regime.
British Caution: The British are going out of their way not 10 sneer at or belittle the Afro-Asian gathering, lest they reinforce the anticolonial attitude which 15 the only unifying factor among most of the 30 nations. Privately they believe that the interests of these nations diverge so widely that they will be able to agree on little beyond meaningless generalities. The British hope Washington will not discourage ""dependable"" pro-Western nations from accepting their invitations and sending strong delegations. The latest test of Communist Chinese intentions was under way in Peking, There the United Nations Secretary

General, Dag Hammarskjold, and Chou were deep in talks on the disposition of some 2,840 U.N. troops including eleven U.S. airmen jailed as spies whom the Chinese Reds still held in violation of the Korean truce. A hint of the possible outcome: Nehru's statement that U.N, handling of the affair was ""unfortunate.""
The Soviets made onc gesture toward the West by releasing in Berlin two Americans who had been held prisone in the notorious Vorkuta slave-labour camp near the Arctic Circle, They were John H. Noble, 31, of Detroit, a civilian arrested in-Dresden in 1945, and Pvt. William Marchuk 38, of Nooristown, Pa., who disappeared in Berlin in 1949.

"ARABS COOL TO INDONESIA TALKS by :
(0.M. Marashian, Special Correspondent of The C.S.M.) The first political conference of Asian and African countries, to be in held in the Indonesian town of Bandung April, is getting a cool reception in Arab capitals.
The initial enthusiasm with which the Arab countries, particularly Egypt, welcomed the idea of the conference, grouping the liberated colonial nations of the non-white world, has given way to doubts and misgivings.
Since the preliminary conference of the five Colombo powers sponsoring
Indonesia Arab India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Burma and leaders have come to realize that the

Bandung conference might be heading toward a direction alien to the countries of the Middle East.
Judging by the declarations of the Colombo powers, that the Middle the proposed agenda of the conference and the list of nations 10 be invited, the impression here is
East countries will have to play second, and even third, fiddle to the Communist and neutralist nations of the Far
East,
To WOO the Arab and African nations, the five sponsors decided not to invite Israel, thanks largely to Pakistan's stubborn efforts, and have announced before hand that they endorsed Tunisian and Moroccan but not Algerian aspirations for independence. These gestures have not helped to stir, or rather revive, Arab enthusiasm for the conference.
This lack of enthusiasm is all the more significant since generally Arabs have a knack for holding high-sounding conferences of emotional value, if only for the propaganda and public-relations purposes, mostly for internal consumption.

Abdel Khaleq Hassouna, Secretary General of the Arab League, recently summoned the Indian and Indonesian Ambassadors in Cairo to demand a greater attention to North Africa in the conference. He asked them to convey to the conference sponsors the wish that nationalist delegates from Tunisian and Moroccan independence groups should not attend the conference as observers, but be permitted to address the gathering.
Mr. Hassouna also voiced dissatisfaction at the sponsoring nations' decision not to invite a delegate from the Arab League secretariat as an observer.
Egypt might have completely ignored the conference had it not been for position and prestige. After all, six out of eight members of the Arab League are Asian countries, even though a world apart from the countries of south and east Asia. Egypt as the leader of the Arab states would like to be present at the conference.
Similarly, by attending the conference as the major African nation, along with Ethiopia, the Gold Coast, Liberia, Libya, and the Sudan, Egypt wants to see to it that African affairs are settled by the Africans themselves,

and not by eager trustees from Asia.
Had this conference taken place a year earlier, when. Egypt had not yet settled its differences with Britain and the
Arab countries were not then in any mood for political and military alignment with the the
West, it might have suited purposes of the Arab leaders to appeal to local public opinion and threaten the Western of neutralism, nations with the bogey
However, the political evolved a thinking of the Arab leaders has progreat deal in the past few months and their Western orientation is no longer a secret.
By attending the tries would
Bandung conference, the Arab counrecognize Communist be facing another dilemma. None of them China and none have the intention

of doing so in the near future despite occasional persuasive talk from the neutralists. Yet, it already appears certain that Communist China's Premier Chou En-Lai will not only be at the conference, but may be in a dominant position.
Already there is the feeling in some neutral quarters that the nations of the Middle East and Africa, for the great part Moslem, will form a bloc within the conference and might stand aloof from the ideological tendencies of the Far East. Incidentally, the Bandung conference will mark the greatest reunion of independent Moslem countries in history. Of the 30 nations to be invited, 14 are Moslem, including the host country, Indonesia.
Already some Indian quarters have voiced concern that Pakistan and Egypt may use the Bandung conference to establish contacts and drum up support for a Moslem bloc and that the conference might indirectly strengthen the hand of Pakistan to successfully block the intentions of neutralist nations.

"ASIA VS. DULLES
While American attention was centered on the Paris debates an event of momentous importance occured at Bogor, Indonesia.
The Prime Ministers of five key Asian States India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon decided to call a peace conference of Asian and African nations next April in Indonesia.
These five Asian leaders decided to invite the People's Republic of China to their peace conference.
They decided NOT to invite the Chiang Kai-shek clique which is kept on Formosa with US arms and US dollars. This action is, of course, a recognition of the realities in Asia, and the Asian leaders are compelled to face up to realities in their part of the world. By the same token, the action is a resounding slap at the stupid and stubborn policy of the State Department which ""recognizes"" the Chiang Kai-shek clique, but refuses to recognize the reality of China.

Moreover, an all-inclusive Asian-African peace conterence as envisioned by the five Prime Ministers, serves to expose the mockery of the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), which Secretary of State John Foster Dulles manufactured some time ago.
You might recall that Dulles' supposedly Asian alliance IS composed of eight members, five of whom are such Asian states as the U.S., Britain, France, Australia and
New Zealand.
What do you suppose the peoples of Asia (and Africa) will think when they compare Dulles' SEATO with the projected 30-nation peace conference, and see that the list of 30 somehow excluded such ""Asian"" states as Britain, France, the U.S., Australia or New Zealand?

to resist
Dulles' SEATO was supposedly fashioned ""Communist aggression,"" but the official communique on the projected Asian-African Conference asserts:
""The conference will work for world peace, economic and social development of Africa and Asia and tackle such special problems as colonialism, racialism and national sovereignty.""
In brief, a bona fide conference of Asian and African peoples proposes to deal with their bona fide problems rather than the nightmare figments of Dulles' imagination. The very calling of the conference, it seems to us, emphasizes the bankruptcy of the Dulles-Eisenhower policy in Asia. It demonstrates that the only support the policy can enlist in Asia is from such miserable puppets as Chiang Kai-shek, who are so despised that they are not even invited to the councils of the Asian peoples.

If we really want a policy that will promote peace and win our friends in Asia, then we should dump Chiang Kaishek and begin dealing with China, the nation without which no real settlement can be attained in Asia.

"BANGKOK AND BANDUNG
In the steaming heat of Bangkok with its glittering temples and turgid canals the Southeast Asian Treaty Organization powers meet to build a defense against an aggressive Communist imperialism.
All the familiar exotic surface of Asia is still there. But there is a new Asia too. It is the Asia of rising nationalism and a blazing desire to master its own destiny.

The Manila Pact Powers Australia, Britain, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United States know this is the dominant force in Asia today. But they recognize the crucial need now for a second force to counteract the outward pressures from Communist China. The effort to draw a tough line down the Formosa Strait is part of the same recognition.
So Bangkok will try to create a military bulwark of some kind; to specify ways to combat and extinguish subversion; and to work out economic aid for underpinning the societies of Asia's Southeast.
This may throw up a barrier for a while. But can we assume It will guarantee against a Communist takeover for all time to come? The Manila Pact is primarily a western operation with only three Asian powers cooperating. The future of Asia will be determined by the thinking and acting of Asia.

We have only to consider the coming April Afro-Asian meeting at Bandung to realize that, The West is excluded. Emphasis is on the colored nations of the world. And for Asia it means that at long last the destiny of Asia is being determined in Asia, and not in Geneva, or Paris, or London, or Washington. Colonialism is out. Hands off is the

byword. Asia is free. This is perhaps the great historic occasion of our century.
So what is there beyond Bangkok? What can be done that will fit into the mood of Bandung?
Asia must be helped toward selfrealization free of domination by communism masquerading as democracy and freedom, and free its own mind of what it sees as western meddling. always suspect because of a colonial past. At Bangkok economic and technical aid will be discussed and this is all to the good. The Commonwealth Colombo Plan with the same goals goes forward. America's Point Four spends its millions and plans one billion more this year. And there is the slender but effective United Nations technical assistance programme.
But the crying need in Asia is for literacy programmes. To read in a democratic atmosphere is to be free. Villagelevel reading and Titing is foundational. Point Four

reinforced this by saying administrator Harold Stassen has agricultural aid must be complemented by education.
Beside education aid, and agricultural and industrial techniques, there is a need of widespread investment, enlarged grants for Asian exchange students in every field, and the export of governmental know-how.
There is a place too for sincere, utterly frank and truthful propaganda information about the United States and the Western way. But this, and the educational and technical programmes, must be rigorously purged of all selfish interest and bread-beating. This is not easy. A good deal can be said for placing more funds in the independent, disinterested hands of the United Nations. This is a programme which could move beyond Bangkok in the mood of Bandung. It requires further disengagement from the colonial past, sacrifice, and humility.

"LET A NEW ASIA AND A NEW AFRICA BE BORN!
Speech of President Sukarno at the opening of the
Asian-African Conference 18th April 1955.

Your Excellencies, Ladies and and Gentlemen.
Sisters and Brothers
It is my great honour and privilege on this historic the day to bid you welcome to Indonesia. On behalf of people and Government of Indonesia your hosts I beg yeur understanding and forbearance if some circumnstances in our country do not meet your expectation. We have, I assure you, done our best to make your stay amongst us memorable for both our guests and your hosts. We hope that the warmth of our welcome will compensate for whatever material shortcomings there may be.

As I survey this hall and the distinguished guests gathered here, my heart is filled with emotion. This is the first intercontinental conference of coloured peoples in the history of mankind ! am proud that my country is your host. I am happy that you were able to accept the invitations extended by the five Sponsoring Countries. But also I cannot restrain feelings of sadness when I recall the tribulations through which many of our peoples have SO recently passed, tribulations which have exacted a heavy toll in life, in-material things, and in the things of the spirit.

I recognise that we are gathered here today as a result of sacrifices. Sacrifices made by our forefathers and by the people of our own and younger generations. For me, this hall is filled not only by the leaders of the nations of Asia and Africa; also contains within its walls the undying, the indomitable, the invincible spirit of those who went before us. Their struggle and sacrifice paved the way for this meeting of the highest representatives of independent and sovereign nations from two of the biggest continents of the globe.
It is a new departure in the history of the world that leaders of Asian and African peoples can meet together in their own countries to discuss and deliberate upon matters of common concern. Only a few decades ago it was frequently necessary to travel to other countries and even other continents before the spokesmen of our peoples could confer.

I recall in this connection the Conference of the ""League Against Imperialism and Colonialism' which was held in Brussels almost thirty years ago. At that Conference many distinguished Delegates who are present here today met each other and found new strength in their fight for independence.

But that was a meeting place thousands of miles away, amidst foreign people, in a foreign country, in a foreign continent. It was not assembled there by choice, but by necessity.
Today the contrast iS great. Our nations and countries are colonies no more. Now we are free, sovereign and independent. We are again masters in our own house. We do not need to go to other continents to confer. Already there have been important meetings of Asian
States in Asia itself.

If we look for the forerunner of this our great gathering, we must look to Colombo, capital of independent Cri Lanka, and to the Conference of the five Prime Ministers which was held there in 1954. And the Bogor Conference in December 1954 showed that the road ahead was clear for Asian-African solidarity, and the Conference to which I have the honour of welcoming you today is the realisation ot that solidarity.
Indeed, I am proud that my country is your host.
But my thoughts are not wholly of the honour which is Indonesia's today. No. My mind is for a part darkened by other considerations.

You have not gathered together in a world of peace and unity and co-operation. Great chasms yawn between nations and groups of nations. Our unhappy world is torn and tortured, and the peoples of all countries walk in fear lest, through no fault of theirs, the dogs of war are unchained once again.
And if in spite of all that the peoples may do, this should happen, what then? What of our newly-recovered independence then What of our culture, what of our spiritual heritage, what of our civilisation? What of our children and our parents ?
The burden of the delegates to this Conference is not a light one, for I know that these questions which are questions of the life or death of humanity itself must be on your minds, as they are on mine. And the nations of Asia and Africa cannot, even if they wish to, avoid their part in finding solutions to these problems.

That is part For that is part of the duties of independence itself. of the price we gladly pay for our independence. For many generations our peoples have been the voiceless ones in the world. We have been the un-

regarded, the peoples for whom decisions were made by others whose interests were paramount, the peoples who lived in poverty and humiliation. Then our nations demanded, nay fought for independence, and achieved independence, and with that independence came responsibility. We have heavy responsibilities to ourselves, and to the world, and to the yet unborn generations. But we do not regret them.
In 1945, the first year of our national revolution, we of Indonesia were confronted with the question of what we were going to do with our independence when it was finally attained and secured we never questioned that it would be attained and secured. We knew how to oppose and destroy. Then we were suddenly confronted with the necessity of giving content and meaning to our independence. Not material content and meaning only, but also ethical and moral content, for independence without ethics, and without morality would be indeed a poor imitation of what we sought. The responsibilities and burdens, the rights and duties and privileges of independence must be seen as part of the ethical and moral content of independence.

Indeed, we welcome the change which places new burdens upon us, and we are all resolved to exert all our strength and courage in carrying these burdens.
Sisters and Brothers, how terrificly dynamic is our time I recall that, several years ago, I had occasion to make a public analysis of colonialism, and that I then drew attention to what I called the ""Life-line of imperialism"". This line runs from the Straits of Gibraltar, through the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the South China Sea and the Sea of Japan. For most of that enormous distance, the territories on both sides of this life-line were colonies, the peoples were unfree, their futures mortgaged to an alien system. Along that life-line, that main artery of imperialism, there was pumped the life-blood of colonialism.

And today in this hall are gathered together the leaders of those same peoples. They are no longer the victims of colonialism. They are no longer the tools of others and the playthings of forces they cannot influence. Today, you are representatives of free peoples, peoples of a different stature and standing in the world.
Yes, here has indeed been a ""Sturm über Asien"" and over Africa too. The last few years have seen enormous changes. Nations, States, have awoken from a sleep of centuries. The passive peoples have gone, the outward tranquillity has made place for struggle and activity. Irresistible forces have swept the two continents. The mental, spiritual and political face of the whole world has been changed, and the process is still not complete. There are new conditions, new concepts, new problems, new ideals abroad in the world. Hurricanes of national awak-

ening and reawakening have swept over the Jand, shaking it, changing it, changing it for better.
This twentieth century has been a period of terrific dynamism. Perhaps the last fifty years have seen more developments and more material progress than the previous five hundred years. Man has learned to control many of the scourges which once theatened him. He has learned to consume distance. He has learned to project his voice and his picture across oceans and continents. He has probed deep into the secrets of nature and learned how to make the desert bloom and the plants of the earth increase their bounty. He has learned how to release the immense forces locked in the smallest particles of matter.

But has man's political skill marched hand-in-hand with his technical and scientific skill? Man can chain lightning to his command can he control the society in which he lives ? The answer is No! The political skill of man has been far outstripped by technical skill, and what he has made he cannot be sure of controlling.
The result of this is fear. And man gasps for safety and morality.

Perhaps now more than at any other moment in the history of the world, society, government and statesmanship need to be based upon the highest code of morality and ethics. And in political terms, what is the highest code of morality ? It is the subordination of everything to the well-being of mankind. But today we are faced with a situation where the well-being of mankind is not always the primary consideration. Many who are in places of high power think, rather, of controlling the world. Yes, we are living in a world of fear. The life of man today is corroded and made bitter by fear. Fear of the

future, fear of the hydrogen bomb, fear of ideologies. itself, Perhaps this fear is a greater danger than the danger because it is fear which drives men to act foolishly, to act thoughtlessly, to act dangerously.
In your deliberations, Sisters and Brothers, I beg of you, do not be guided by these fears, because fear is an Be acid which etches man's actions into curious patterns. guided by hopes and determination, be guided by ideals, and, yes, be guided by dreams We are of many different nations, we are of many
Our different social backgrounds and cultural patterns. ways of life are different. Our national characters, OT colours or motifs call it what you will are different. Our racial stock is different, and even the colour of our skin is different. But what does that matter ? Mankind is united or divided by considerations other than these. Conflict comes not from variety of skins, not from variety of religion, but from variety of desires.

All of us, I am certain, are united by more important things than those which superficially divide us. We are united, for instance, by a common detestation of colonialism In whatever form it appears. We are united by a common detestation of racialism. And we are united by a common determination to preserve and stabilise peace in the world. Are not these aims mentioned in the letter of invitation to which you responded ?
I freely confess it in these aims I am not disinterested or driven by purely impersonal motives.

How is it possible to be disinterested about colonialism? For us, colonialism is not something far and distant. We have known it in all its ruthlessness. We have seen the immense human wastage it causes, the poverty it causes, and the heritage it leaves behind when, eventually and reluctantly, it iS driven out by the inevitable march of history. My people, and the peoples of many nations of Asia and Africa know these things, for we have experienced them.
Indeed, we cannot yet say that all parts of our countries are free already. Some parts still labour under the lash. And some parts of Asia and Africa which are not represented here still suffer from the same condition.

Yes, some parts of our nations are not yet free. That is why all of us cannot yet feel that journey's end has been reached. No people can feel themselves free, so long as part their motherland is unfree. Like peace, freedom is indivisible. There is no such thing as being half free, as there is no such thing as being half alive.
We are often told ""Colonialism is dead"". Let us not be deceived or even soothed by that. I say to you, colonialism is not yet dead. How can we say it is dead, so long as vast areas of Asia and Africa are unfree.

And, I beg of you, do not think of colonialism only in the classic form which we of Indonesia, and our brothers and Africa, knew. Colonialism in different parts of Asia has also its modern dress, in the form of economic control, intellectual control, actual physical control by a small but alien community within a nation. It is a skilful and determined enemy, and it appears in many guises. It does not give up its loot easily. Wherever, whenever, and however it appears, colonialism is an evil thing, and one which must be eradicated from the earth.
The battle against colonialism has been a long one, and do you know that today is a famous anniversary in that-battle ? On the eighteenth day of April, one thousand seven hundred and seventy five, just one hundred and eighty years ago, Paul Revere rode at midnight through the New England countryside, warning of the approach of British troops and of the opening of the American War of Independence, the first successful anti-colonial war in history. About this midnight ride the poet Longfellow wrote

A cry of defiance and not of fear, A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door, And a word that shall echo for evermore
Yes, it shall echo for evermore, just as the other anti-colonial words which gave us comfort and reassurance during the darkest days of our struggle shall echo for evermore. But remember, that battle which began 180 years ago is not yet completely won, and it will not have been completely won until we can survey this our own world, and can say that colonialism is dead.
So, I am not disinterested when I speak of the fight against colonialism.
Nor am I disinterested when I speak of the battle for peace. How can any of us be disinterested about peace ?
Not SO very long ago we argued, that peace was necessary for us because an outbreak of fighting in our part of the world would imperil our precious independence, so recently won at such great cost.

Today, the picture is more black. War would not only mean a threat to our independence, it may mean the end of civilisation and even of human life. There is a force loose in the world whose potentiality for evil no man truly knows. Even in practice and rehearsal for war the effects may well be building up into something of unknown horror.
Not so long ago it was possible to take some little comfort from the idea that the clash, if it came, could perhaps be settled by what were called ""conventional weapons"" men. that little bombs, tanks, cannon and Today made clear that grain of comfort is denied us, for it has been the weapons of ultimate horror will

certainly be used, and the military planning, of nations on that, basis. The unconventional has become the conventional, and who, knows what other examples of misguided and diabolical scientific skill have been discovered as a plague on humanity.
And do not think the oceans and the seas will protect us, The food that we cat, the water that we drink, yes, even the very air that we breathe can be contaminated by poisons originating from thousands of miles away. And it could be that, even if we ourselves escaped lightly, the unborn generations of our children would bear on their distorted bodies the marks of our failure to control the forces which have been released on the world.
No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace. Without peace our independence means little. The rehabilitation and up-building of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to-run their course.

What can we do? The peoples of Asia and Africa wield little physical power. Even their economic strength is dispersed and slight. We cannot indulge in power politics. Diplomacy for us is not a matter of the big stick. Our statesmen, by and large, are not backed up with serried ranks of jet bombers.
What can we do ? Wecan do much ! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilise all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1,400,000,000 strong, far more than half the human population of the world, we can mobilise what have called the Moral Violence of Nations in favour of peace. We can demonstrate to the minority of the world which lives on the other continents that we, the majority, are for peace, not for war, and that whatever strength we have will always be thrown on to the side of peace.

In this struggle, some success has already been scored. think it is generally recognised that the activity of the Prime Ministers of the Sponsoring Countries which invited you here had a not unimportant role to play in ending the fighting in Indo-China.
Look, the peoples of Asia raised their voices, and the world listened. It was no small victory and no negligible precedent The five Prime Ministers did not make threats. They issued no ultimatum, they mobilised no troops. Instead they consulted together, discussed the issues, pooled their ideas, added together their individual political skills and came forward with sound and reasoned suggestions which formed the basis for a settlement of the long struggle in Indo-China.
1 have often since then asked myself why these five were successful when others with long records of diplo-

-macy, were unsuccessful, and, in fact, had allowed a bad situation to get worse, so that there was a danger of the conflict spreading, Was it because they were Asians? Maybe that is part of the answer, for the conflagration Was on their doorstep, and any extension of it would have presented an immediate threat to their own houses. But I think that the answer really lies in the fact that those five Prime Ministers brought a fresh approach to bear on the problem, They were not seeking advantage for their own countries. They had no axe of power-politics to grind. They had but one interest how to end the fighting in such a way that the chances of continuing peace and stability were enchanced.
That, my Sisters and Brothers, was an historic occasion. Some countries of free Asia spoke, and the world listened. They spoke on a subject of immediate concern to Asia, and in doing so made it quite clear that the affairs of Asia are the concern of the Asian peoples themselves. The days are now long past when the future of Asia can be settled by other and distant peoples.

However, we cannot, we dare not, confine our interests to the affairs of our own continents. The States of the world today depend one upon the other and no nation can be an island unto intself. Splendid isolation may once have been possible; it is so no longer. The affairs of all the world are our affairs, and our future depends upon the solutions found to all international problems, however far or distant they may seem.
As I survey this hall, my thoughts gO back to another Conference of Asian peoples. In the beginning of 1949 historically speaking only a moment ago my country was for the second time since our Proclamation of Independence engaged in a life and death struggle. Our nation was besieged and beleaguered, much of our territory occupied, 21 great part of our leaders imprisoned or exiled. our existence as a State threatened.

Issues were being decided, not in the conference chamber, but on the battlefield. Our envoys then were rifles, and cannon, and bombs, and grenades, and bamboospéars. We were blockaded, physically and intellectually. It was at that sad but glorious moment in our national history that our good neighbour India convened a Con ference of Asian and African Nations in New Delhi, to protest against the injustice committed against Indonesia and to give support to our struggle. The intellectual blockade was broken Our Delegates flew to New Delhi and learned at first hand of the massive support which was being given to our struggle for national existence. Never before in the history of mankind has such solidarity of Asian and African peoples been shown for the rescue of fellow Asian Nation in danger. The diplomats and statesmen, the Press and the common men

of our Asian and African neighbours were all supporting us. We were given fresh courage to press our struggle onwards to its final successful conclusion. We again realised to the full the truth of Desmoulin's statement: ""Have no doubt of the omnipotence of a free people"".
Perhaps in some ways the Conference which has assembled here today has some roots in that manifestation of Asian-African solidarity six years ago.
However that may be, the fact remains that everyone of you bears a heavy responsibility, and I pray to God that the responsibility will be discharged with courage and wisdom.
I pray to God that this Asian-African Conference succeeds in doing its job.

a
Ah, Sisters and Brothers, let this Conference be great success! In spite of diversity that exists among its participants, let this Conference be a great success Yes, there is diversity among us. Who denies it ? Small and great nations are represented here, with people professing almost every religion under the sun, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Shintoism, and others. Almost every political faith we encounter here Democracy, Monarchism, Theoracy, with innumerable variants. And practically every economic doctrine has its representative in this hall Marhaenism, Socialism, Capitalism, Communism, in all their manifold variations and combinations.

But what harm IS in diversity, when there is unity in desire ? This Conference is not to oppose each other, it is a conference of brotherhood. It is not an Islam Conference. It is not a meeting of Malayans, nor one of Arabs, nor one of Indo-Aryan stock. It is not an exclusive club either, not a bloc which seeks to oppose any other bloc. Rather it is a body of enlightened, tolerant opinion which seeks to impress on the world that all men and all countries have their place under the sun to impress on the world that it is possible to live together, meet together, speak to each other, without losing one's individual identity; and yet to contribute to the general understanding of matters of common concern, and to develop a true consciousness of the interdependence of men and nations for their well being and survival on earth.

I know that in Asia and Africa there is greater diveristy of religions, faiths, and belief, than in the other continents of the world. But that is only natural Asia and Africa are the classic birthplaces of faiths and ideas, which have spread all over the world. Therefore, it behoves us to take particular care to ensure that the principle which is usually called the ""Live and let live"" principle mark, I do not say the principle of ""Laissez

is faire, laissez passer"" of Liberalism which is obsolete completely within our own first of all applied by us most Asian and African frontiers. Then only can it be fully extended to our relations with our neighboring countries, and to others more distant.

Religion is of dominating importance particularly in this part of the world. There are perhaps more religions here than in other regions of this globe. But, again, our countries were the birthplaces of religions. Must we be divided by the multiformity of our religious life? It is true, each religion has its own history, its own individuality, its own
""raison d'étre"", its special pride in its own truths which it desires beliefs, its own mission, its special to propagate. But unless we realise that all great religions are one in their message of tolerance and in their insistence on the observance of the principle of ""Live and let live"", unless the followers of each religion are prepared to give the same consideration to the rights of others everywhere, unless every State does its duty to ensure that faiths the same rights are given to the followers of all unless these things are done, religion is debased, and its true purpose perverted. Unless Asian-African countries realise their responsibilities in this matter and take steps jointly to fulfil them, the very strength of religious beliefs, which should be a source of unity and a bulwark against foreign interference, will cause its disruption, and may result in destroying the hardwon freedom which large parts of Asia and Africa have achieved by acting together.

Sisters and Brothers, Indonesia is Asia-Africa in small. It is a country with many religions and many faiths. We have in Indonesia Moslims, we have Christians, we have Civa-Buddhists, we have peoples with other creeds. Moreover, we have many ethnic units, such as Achenese, Bataks, Central-Sumatrans, Sundanese, CentralJavanese, Madurese, Toradjas, Balinese, etc. But thank God, we have our will to unity. We have our Pancha Sila. We practise the ""Live and let live"" principle, we are tolerant to each other. Bhinneka Tunggal Ika Unity in Diversity is the motto of the Indonesian State. We are one nation.
So, let this Asian-African Conference be a great success ! Make the ""Live and let live"" principle and the ""Unity in Diversity"" motto the unifying force which brings us all together to seek in friendly, uninhibited discussion, ways and means by which each of us can live his own life, and let others live their own lives, in their own way, in harmony, and in peace.

If we succeed in doing so, the effect of it for the freedom, independence and the welfare of man will be great on the world at large. The Light of Understanding has again been lit, the Pillar of Cooperation again erected The likelihood of success of this Conference is proved already by the very presence of you all here today. It

is for us to give it strength, to give it the power of inspiration to spread its message all over the World. Failure will mean that the Light of Understanding which seemed to have dawned in the East the Light towards which looked all the great religions born here in the past has again been obscured by an unfriendly cloud before man could benefit from its warm radiance. But let us be full of hope and full of confidence. We have SO much in common.
Relatively speaking, all of us gathered here today are neighbours. Almost all of us have ties of common experience, the experience of colonialism. Many of us have a common religion. Many of us have common cultural roots. Many of us, the so-called ""underdeveloped"" nations, have more or less similar economic problems, SO that each can profit from the others' experience and help. And I think I may say that we all hold dear the ideals of national independence and freedom. Yes, we have so much in common. And yet we know so little of each other.

If this Conference succeeds in making the peoples of the East whose representatives are gathered here understand each other a little more, appreciate each other a little more, sympathise with each other's problems a little more if those things happen, then this Conference, of course, will have been worthwhile, whatever else it may achieve. But I hope that this Conference will give more than understanding only and goodwill only I hope that it will falsify and give the lie to the saying of one diplomat from far abroad: ""We will turn this Asian-African Conference into an afternoon-tea meeting"". I hope that it will give evidence of the fact that we Asian and African leaders understand that Asia and Africa can prosper only when they are united, and that even the safety of the World at large can not be safeguarded without a united Asia-Africa. I hope that this Conference will give guidance to mankind, will point out to mankind the way which it must take

to attain safety and peace. I hope that it will give evidence that Asia and Africa have been reborn, nay, that a New Asia and a New Africa have been born I
Our task is first to seek an understanding of each other, and out of that understanding will come a greater appreciation of each other, and out of that appreciation will come collective action. Bear in mind the words of one of Asia's greatest sons: ""To speak is easy. To act is hard. To understand is hardest. Once one understands, action is easy"".
I have come to the end. Under God, may your deliberations be fruitful, and may your wisdom strike sparks of light from the hard flints of today's circumstances.
Let us not be bitter about the past, but let us keep our eyes firmly on the future. Let us remember that no blessing of God is so sweet as life and liberty. Let us remember that the stature of all mankind is diminished so long as nations or parts of nations are still unfree. Let us remember that the highest purpose of man is the liberation of man from his bonds of fear, his bonds of human degradation, his bonds of poverty the liberation of man from

the physical, spiritual and intellectual bonds-which have for too long stunted the development of humanity's majority.
And let us remember, Sisters and Brothers, that for the sake of all that, we Asians and Africans must be united. As President of the Republic of Indonesia, and on behalf of the eighty million people of Indonesia, I bid you welcome to this country. I declare the Asian-African Conference opened, and I pray that the Blessing of God will be upon it, and that its discussions will be profitable to the peoples of Asia and Africa, and to the peoples of all nations !
Bismillah!

"Address by Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo of Indonesia President of the Asian-African Conference

Your Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends.
May I first of all express my gratitude for your confidence by entrusting me with the task of President of this Conference. consider this not merely as a great honour to myself, but also and in the first place, to Indonesia and its people.
In the address of His Excellency President Sukarno to which we have just listened, a cordial welcome has been extended to you all on behalf of the Indonesian people and its Government. I should like to associate myself with the President's words of welcome. We are, indeed, much honoured that this Conference, this event of such great historical significance, is taking place in our country.

It is my privilege to welcome you also on behalf of the other sponsoring countries, Burma, Ceylon, India and

Pakistan, who together with Indonesia have convened this Conference.• I may express our deep gratitude because, notwithstanding great responsibilities at home and elsewhere, the statesmen and many high officials from 29 countries, representing many hundreds of millions of people in the enormous area of Asia and Africa, are, for the first time in history, assembled here under this one roof.
When extending our welcome wholeheartedly to you all, I include also the representatives of the press who have flocked together from all parts of the globe, and whose presence we may take as proof that the of the world are upon us.

May I further welcome those who have come to attend this Conference as interested visitors and informal observers.
Unfortunately a dark shadow was cast over this Con-ference when we learned with much regret that by a tragic air-accident not all those who were on their way to Ban-

dung would be present amongst us. May 1 convey our sincere condolences to the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China, of India, and the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, and to the families of all who lost their lives in this disaster.
I have to make an apology beforehand. Jointly with the other sponsoring countries we have done our best to make adequate arrangements for your comfort and well-being, as well as for the organisation and technical equipment of this Conference. We hope the results of our efforts will prove to be satisfactory. We are well aware, however, that shortcomings there will be, and for which we ask your indulgence.

From the moment that our intention to convene this Conference was mentioned in the world press, there have been many speculations about its aims and purposes. There were utterances giving voice to hope and optimism, that at this Conference, a great and unique effort would be made to find a new way to overcome the impasse prevailing in the world of to-day. There were utterances as well of doubts and even suspicions, as if it were our aim to create another source of tension by constituting an anti-western and even an anti-white bloc.
The purposes my Colleagues and I had in mind were formulated in our joint-communique issued at the Closing of the Bogor-Conference. It was precisely these purposes on which our invitation to attend this Conference was based, and it was these very purposes on which 29 Governments of Asia and Africa could agree.

Allow me to quote from paragraph 4 of our jointcommunique the precise wording. Our purposes are: a) to promote goodwill and co-operation among the nations of Asia and Africa, to explore and advance their mutual as well as common interests and to establish and further. friendliness and neighbourly relations; b) to consider social, economic and cultural problems and relations of the countries represented; c) to consider problems of special interest to Asian and African peoples, e.g. problems affecting national sovereignty and of racialism and colonialism; and most important in my opinion d) to view the position of Asia and Africa and their peoples in the world of to-day and the contribution they can make to the promotion of world-peace and co-operation.

The fact that we are gathered here together and I should like to stress this point is proof that we are in general agreement on these purposes. Let these purposes therefore be our guidance in our discussions.

This Conference is not the result of some wishful thinking, neither was it born by the urge to solve a specific and acute political controversy, nor by a desire to arrive at a new alliance of power.
It could be said that this Conference was born out of the fulness of time which has entrusted to the independent nations of Asia and Africa their new task in the destiny of mankind, but I venture to state that the foremost reason which gave birth to this Conference was the agonizing tensions from which the world is suffering to-day.
In making clear to ourselves and tO the world what our common task is, we have to answer, firstly, the question: where do we, the peoples of Asia and Africa, stand, and for what do we stand in this world dominated by fear, fear that any one day another war may be unleashed upon mankind bringing horrors of destruction never dreamed of before.

When I answer this question by stating that we stand for peace, and for peace only, I quite realize that this sentence has been uttered many times before, even to a degree that it became very nearly a platitude.
What do we want when we say: peace? Not peace in the sense of a replacement of war. Not in the sense of an uneasy balance of power used as a deterrent for war; nor in the sense of cold war as the only possible alternative to hot war. The present precarious balance of power may shift in the near future, and nobody can predict what kind of action or incident will change the cold war overnight into a full-scale shooting war. In its present state it is fear and suspicion not faith which dominates the world.

Nor do we understand as peace a state of affairs where one power, more formidable than the others, would be able to dominate the rest of the world, thus imposing its will and dictating its own conception of peace. This is the false kind of peace we read about in history when the the might of Rome could enforce peace around Mediterranean and in large regions beyond, labelling it proudly as ""pax romana"", but ever with the thought in mind: ""si vis pacem para bellum !""
We do not need, however, to look back too far in history, because in this atomic age we are experiencing the frightening race of atomic armaments, aiming to achieve superiority one above the other in order to fulfil the dream of another peace by domination. I call it a be dream because at the awakening there would not another peace by domination but only the total destruction of mankind.

We do not want any domination either by force or by ideology, no matter from whatever quarter it may come.

What we do want is genuine peace. On a previous occasion,
1 said that genuine peace is an absolute value and therefore a necessity. We know too well from the lessons of history that power politics, with an uneasy but balance of power in its wake, cannot guarantee peace will lead sooner or later to war.
Having this firmly in mind, to us there can only be ouC answer, one way to avoid war and to establish genuine peace.
We have to promote with all our strength that the world be free from fear and suspicion. The building of a position of armed strength which causes so much tension rid in the world, is basically the endeavour of man to himself of fear, fear of being destroyed by the other side. But unfortunately the other side is thinking the same way. This is the reason why fear and suspicion are still SO prevalent in the world of tension we know to-day. We have to give the world faith in which alone humanity can prosper without fear or suspicion.

The prerequisite of this is the willingness and determination of living neighbourly together, irrespective of each other's political, social or religious ideologies, on the principles of mutual respect for each other's national sovereignty and each other's territorial integrity; abhorrence of aggression; non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit.
In very recent times these principles have strongly been voiced and stressed by outstanding leaders and statesmen of Asia and Africa as the ""conditio sine qua non"" for achieving Deace in the world.
Although I know that we, gathered here in this hall, have different opinions about them, these principles are nevertheless of the greatest concern to us all.
Unfortunately enough, there have been many suspicions, misgivings and misinterpretations about these principles, Is it because these principles were voiced and stressed by leaders and statesmen of Asia and Africa who were spoken of as being unrealistic day-dreamers ?

may put one more question: who are the unrealistic day-dreamers, is it the believers in the principles just mentioned, or is it those who foster the illusion that stockpiling of atom and hydrogen bombs can bring about peace ?
It was by analysing history and the present-day race for atomic superiority that leaders and statesmen of Asia and Africa reached the inevitable conclusion that all this stockpiling and armament must lead to a war of total destruction.
Consequently, it is the Asian and African conception which has to be considered as the logical and realistic answer to the question how to attain genuine peace.
Undoubtedly we shall be asked how we, the peoples of Asia and Africa, intend to put these principles into practice.

It is obvious that we neither wish nor can evade the answer to this question, and it is precisely this Conference which can contribute so much to the right answer by its discussions and resolutions.
mentioned already the purposes formulated in the Bogor communique. To materialize these purposes we have to start with ourselves by promoting goodwill and co-operation amongst the peoples of Asia and Africa; establish and further good and neighbourly relations.
This, in my opinion, implies that we must try and to eliminate find, in a common effort, ways and means the sources of conflict which cause international tensions. Furthermore, we are faced with the task to try and find a solution to the problem of United Nations membership for Asian and African countries which for one reason or another are debarred from it.

Above all, we have to induce people all over the world by our own example to think in terms of peace and not in terms of balance of power, nor of power politics, suspicions and fear.
Among the main causes of the present-day tensions there is colonialism, the old scourge under which Asia and Africa have suffered for ages, which will be a subject of our special interest. It may be true that the larger part of mankind accepts the obvious truth that colonialism has to be considered as a thing of the past, but the fact is there that colonialism is still very much alive. When we look at the map of Asia and Africa we find many spots, and even whole countries which are still fettered by the chains of colonialism. Moreover, in the flesh of several of us are still sticking the thorns, small or large, of colonial rule.
We see also that former colonial powers still endeavour to continue their control, in one disguise or another, over ex-colonial or semi-colonial countries.

What is even worse, we have to witness that the principle of self-determination is misused as a cover for colonial purposes.
Our brothers in colonial territories, all those who are still fighting against colonial domination as we ourselves did in the recent past, might reproach us for discussing their interests in their absence. They may ask us why we do this, and why we did not invite them to attend this Conference ?
We regret indeed that we had to restrict ourselves. Once the principle of holding this Conference amongst independent Governments of Asia and Africa was accepted, we saw no way to grant their wishes to be represented. I may assure them, however and I know 1 am speaking on behalf of you all when I say our thoughts are very much with our brothers who are still living in bondage.

I hope that one day, and may it be soon, the opportunity will arise, or be created, to convene the representatives of independence movements in all colonial territories who are still struggling for the liquidation of colonial rule and for their national independence and sovereignty. We, the independent countries of Asia and Africa, have to do oUr utmost in supporting them in every peaceful effort which may achieve their freedom.
Recently there have been many statements made by colonial powers expressing their good intentions to end colonialism. I regret, however, to say that good intensions alone are not sufficient to abolish colonialism altogether from the world. More important for us are their deeds and policies which may give proof to the world of the sincerity of their good intentions.

Next to colonialism we meet racialism as an important. source of tension. Racialism in fact is often, if not always, an aspect of colonialism based on feelings of superiority of the dominating group. Discrimination, however, based on differences of colour is contrary to the fundamental human rights, to the essential equality of mankind as rightly expressed in the Charter of the United Nations. In today's world we are still a long way off from this equality and respect for human rights. How often are the timid attempts to have done with colour-bars outweighed by measures of ruthless discrimination? Is not apartheid-policy a form of absolute intolerance more befitting the Dark Ages than this modern world ?
I am certain that this Conference will find it its duty to consider the problem of racialism in its various aspects.

Another and very serious source of tension is the low standard of living in practically all Asian and African countries. For centuries our countries have poured a neverending stream of profits into the dominating countries, but we ourselves stayed poor and under-developed. During the aftermath of World War II we won our independence, but our political freedom could not yet bring us economic independence, could not yet erase the backwardness and underdevelopment which our peoples had suffered from for so long.
In fact, most of the countries of Asia and Africa are still in a period of transition from colonial to national economy.

Meanwhile our populations are increasing at high rates and although we have managed so far to feed and clothe them, often with a bare minimum, we are still far off from welfare-states. We are planning planning to the best our abilities for the development of our countries, but our limited means are often an insurmountable obstacle to the implementation of well-devised plans.
We cannot change this all overnight, but what we certainly can do is to co-operate closely amongst ourselves

in the economic field, to learn from each other, to assist each other, to devise ways and means to increase interregional trade, and gradually stay independent in the economic sense.
There is another field in which we can benefit largely by cooperation, i.e. the cultural field. The civilisations of Asia and Africa penetrated deeply into all corners of the earth, but gradually their impact on international affairs was lost because we concentrated too much on the spiritual aspect while neglecting the material side indispensable to progress as we have witnessed in the phenomenal advance of technology in the world of today.

We have learned this lesson. We have found our selfexpression in our independence. We know that the advancement for which our peoples are eagerly longing, needs the impetus and the help of modern technology. There is no going back to the ages of mere contemplation. But equally we do not want to lose our soul in technology. We want to keep our valuable cultural heritage, and it is here that we have so much in common however different our religions may be.
Let us therefore co-operate to foster this heritage, giving it new life and expression in conformity with the requirements of the modern world.
This may be the substance which we should give to the resurgence of Asia and Africa.
The task we are entrusted with to make our contribution to world peace and co-operation has befallen us at a very important turn of world history, the beginning of the atomic age.

When the age of technology made its entry a hundred years ago, changing by its profound impact the lives of people all over the world, first in the west, but gradually in Asia and Africa too, it brought us steam, electricity, mechanisation, factories and many other things beneficial to the progress of all. It brought mankind also new ways of thinking and consciousness of social justice, but in its wake followed conquest, imperialism, war and destruction. At present we are standing at the threshold of another new era, facing the tremendous consequences of the progress of nuclear science. New and formidable sources of energy are discovered in the world of atoms, the technical intricacy of which is far beyond the knowledge of the ordinary layman. But what we all understand is that these new forces can be used either to benefit mankind Or to destory him utterly. What we notice at present is that these new inventions, instead of being used for peaceful purposes and world progress, are being held in utmost secrecy, with the primary aim of building-up positions of strength.

Never before has mankind experienced such a frightening situation where powers of great might, commanding

the inexhaustible recources which science and technology have put at their disposal, are building-up daily positions of ever-increasing strength in world-politics.
It looks as if mankind is not morally prepared for the fruits of its own genius. from
Let us, the peoples of Asia and Africa, not be overwhelmed by the revolutionary changes resulting our daily life atomic technology which will enter into and thinking. Let us be prepared for these tremendous changes which I believe are not far away anymore. They have to be welcomed in our minds and hearts as a new step forward on the path of progress of mankind.

But we have also to be aware that we cannot enter into this atomic age with the same spirit, political Or social beliefs, and moral attitudes only befitting the period which is about to draw to a close.
We have to face the birth of the atomic age with a new spirit, new ideologies and new universal morality which should form the basis of peaceful and brotherly intercourse between nations all over the world.
Ladies and Gentlemen, The world is following this Conference with great interest and high hopes. With great interest, because our gathering together on this large scale is a new and unique phenomenon in history. With high hopes, because many, all over the world, expect us to show them a way out of the impasse we find ourselves in to-day.

J received last month a letter signed by fourteen outstanding Americans, all leading figures in the fields of

the hope that science, religion and literature, expressing this meeting will fulfil our highest expectations. They solution you said:
""We shall be watching you, because any discover should help us all"". from all
Besides, many more letters and messages corners of the carth were sent to me by people of every walk of life voicing similar hopes.
The whole world is indeed watching us with hopes and expectations. howLet uS therefore all speak the same language, ever much our tongues and our ideologies may differ, of Asia and the language which not only the peoples
Africa will understand, but which will be understood by the whole world.

Let us realize fully that it iS our duty to make a solid contribution to the promotion of world peace and cooperation.
On the other hand, let the rest of the world take due of the notice that it is the voice of nearly two-thirds world's population which will be heard from this Conference-hall.
If we are able to express our desire and determination for peace in unmistakable terms, if our labours will have some salutary influence on the way of thinking of mankind, if we can contribute to the eliminating of fear and want so eagerly hoped for by all, then this Conference will have fulfilled its historical task.
May the Almighty grant us wisdom and tolerance in our discussions.",general,,Ali Sastroamidjojo,,
"NEW ASIA AFRICA
Next Monday the sun will rise on an event such as has never taken place since God created the Universe. The mountain breezes will whisper the event to the beaches and the waves will breathe it to the beaches of the entire world.
The Asian African Conference is taking place ten years after the combined strength of the Soviet Union, the United States of America and Britain compelled the fascism of Hitler-Mussolini-Tojo to crumble in the battlefield, ten years after the United States of America dropped the atom bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima as an experiment wrought upon the peoples of Asia, and ten years after the spiritual basis of the United Nations Organisation was established.

In those ten years the atom bomb has been perfected as an instrument of death and destruction. It has even produced its sister, the hydrogen bomb, which in destructive force surpasses the atom bomb.
But the tree of peace, whose roots were sprinkled with tears of hope after the end of the War, now seems to be far from fresh. The United Nations Organisation, which was expected to become the meeting place of statesmen in search of ways to make concrete the principles of humanity in terms of prosperity and happiness, has now become the scene of suspicions and of efforts of nations to strangle one another. The close friendship between the Soviet Union, America and Britain has ceased to exist. It is not peace, but the will to war, not justice but injustice, not independence but imperialism which is now dominant in the United Nations Organisation. The United Nations Organisation has become the instrument of those in power in America.

This dissatisfaction with U.N.O is one of the things which has caused these Asian nations who are really against imperialism and do not want to side with this bloc or that bloc, to take the initiative to set up a new Asian-African platform on which the nations of Asia and Africa through their representatives can have discussions uninfluenced by the countries who want to light the flames of discord.
A new Asia Africa ! Let Asia Africa unite The new Asia Africa-does not want to be under the ""leadership"" or protection"" of the Western countries which means nothing but colonialism wrapped in silk ! Asia and Africa

are united, because their countries need unity and friendship badly for their individual as well as collective progress.
There are those who state that several delegations will bring forward the voice. of their masters in the Conference, namely the voice of America andBritain. However AS YET we do not believe such gossip not until we hear and see its truth.
There is news for instance that the Philippine delegation is bringing instructions of portent which will be a time-bomb in the Conference and that Romulo whom we honour as our guest will do his utmost to prevent the admission of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. We won't believe this until we hear the time-bomb explode, not until we hear the voice of Romulo himself.

Our honored guest General Romulo certainly realizes that to refuse to a state like the People's Republic of China with a population of 500,000,000 membership of a body established for the very purpose of bringing all states together, is diametrically opposed to justice. The Philippines is an Asian country. Fancy an Asian country feeling itself closer to the West which still has the will to colonialism than to an Asian which has the will to freedom and self-development.
The Philippines has given birth to a great man, a man who has struggled heroically for freedom and justice. Jose Rizal was a Philippine hero, a hero of the Malay race, a hero. of Asia, a hero of the East! We are confident that the Philippine delegation. will not betray the spirit of Rizal, and therefore we do not believe that there will be voices raised in the interests of the West.

"INDONESIA INDIA CO STAR
By Gordon Graham The growing friendship between India and Indonesia is seen by observers in Asia as both a cause and an effect of the Asian African project. Already the pillar and unifying forces of the Colombo Powers, these two great Nations are now about to lend their combined strength to the proposition that the past colonial Nations of Asia and Africa can hold the balance and keep the peace between the East and West.

Last December on the Bogor occasion, which was. a
Sukarno meeting of the Colombo Powers, observers remarked on the respect and affection with which President of Indonesia treated the Indian Leader. Western and
Asian observers say that Indonesian understanding is not only the cohesive of the Colombo Group but the counterbalance which makes the Manila Pact (Seato) group essentially not representative of non-Communist Asia. Stretching from the borders of China to those of Australia, and comprising a 16th of the world's peoples, India and Indonesia together dominate the future of Southern Asia even as China and Japan dominate the North. Any plan to preserve the integrity of the area is considered meaningless without their cooperation.

Whatever decisions the Asian African Conference reaches will require the full support of both these powers. It will rest chiefly on them to restrain or encourage
Associa
Communist China's influence on the assemblage. tion with India may well help Indonesia to attain more balance in its international outlook, which still is preoccupied more with the dangers of colonialism than anything else.

"THE BANDUNG ASIAN-AFRICAN CONFERENCE By Jules Sauerwein
They are not inviting any European nation considering the white race as stained by ""colonialism"" and they are going to listen to the complaints of one or the other, as well as copious expositions of doctrine, to arrive perhaps, finally, at no practical result. This is not to say that this gathering which comprises the colours that go from yellow to black is of no importance. It would be shallowness on our part to overlook the fact that the inviting powers possess, by themselves alone, six hundred million persons, and that the twenty-five invited speak in the name of one billion. They therefore represent a considerable portion of the human species.

To take a stand against one Or the other of the two armed blocs of the world, would be an imprudence, and, for the moment at least, they do not think of that. None of them possesses an atomic or thermo-nuclear bomb. But we shall see in Bandung Communist China who with the might which her half a billion population gives her, her success in Geneva, and the beginning of her arms drive under Russian tutelage, will try to secure a preponderating position. In spite of the remonstrances of the Philippines, Siam, Turkey, and other allies of the West, if the enormous wavering mass inclines towards any side, it will

probably be towards the Soviet block. China will arrive at the Conference carrying subtle and tempting suggestions, stemming indirectly from Moscow, and she will proclaim herself a fervent. friend of the coloured peoples who desire to win their freedom.
There is no doubt that in the assembly there will be anti-communists. Unfortunately, the most powerful of them all, Japan, has left sad recollections in Indonesia. Islam, which is the religion of 90% of the Indonesians, and of many of the participating countries, is opposed to Communism in all its principles. But China will carry great weight and in Indonesia herself she has an active colony of three million nationals, perhaps divided but communistic in the greater part.

The most disturbing factor is that the conference's objectives are vague. For example, for economic development, which clearly is the prime need of that one billion and a half of human beings, it is certain that American, British, French or Dutch help, is worth more to Asia than the mutual goodwill amongst peoples so opposite and unarmed. Hate for the white master of former times, or of to-day, incites that multitude. But inthe resolutions of Bogor, which form the programme of the coming Conference, there is an article, number 14, which seems to me to be highly elucidating for one who seeks the origins of human undertakings not in lucid plans, which hardly ever exist, but in the primordial feelings that dwell in all human hearts. For those peoples born but recently for an independent life the strongest of sentiments, stronger even than hate, is fear, the fear of destruction. Article 14 expresses ""the grave concern caused by the nuclear explosions and the fear of those devices"" that threaten the world and human organisms with lasting destruction. The Asians know that in the face of that peril the number of

combatants counts for little. As their anguished appeal will certainly not be listened to, and as bomb U follows bomb H while the cobalt bomb is awaited, we have to fear that the legitimate terror of those peoples may be exploited by the simple method of offering to them the armament which will probably serve to attract the thunderbolt that will fall over them, but which to their oriental imagination should appear like a charm and the guarantee of their beloved freedom.

In short, this spectacular conference is actually a kind of a vast whirl of panic, as happens in anthills on the approach of some collective danger. Let us forget appearances and even the perturbing possibilities for our particular interests and let us face the problem of the West. It consists in calming that immense flock before it delivers itself up to bad shepherds and before it is too lateto influence it. This would indeed be the mission of the white bearers of power, were they not so deeply divided.
Diario Popular, Lisbon, 9-3-55.",press,,,Europe,
"We do not think that we are meeting at Bandung for a trial. Our ideal and aspirations are well known. But what should characterize our conference, is that (a) It puts in concrete form, for the very first time, the solidarity of African and Asian peoples, in their common love of freedom, equality, peace and welfare. (b) It shatters the frontiers which separated two worlds: the communist and the non-communist. In this respect, our conference appears to be an Afro-Asian offspring of the United Nations Assembly and offers an opportunity for regretting that the United Nations have not yet opened their doors to some nations having already obviously fulfilled the conditions of sovereignty and capacity required for membership.

(c) It is capable of contributing considerably towards international security and co-operation, by fostering all over the world two ideals which most typically mark mankind i.e. first of all freedom and independence for all the peoples of the world, and then world Peace which comes as a corollary and even a consequence of the first ideal.
I will lay emphasis on this Peace which, though not being atomic powers and precisely because we are not atomic powers we may have the privilege of achieving, as a result of the unprecedented union of out countries

and thanks to our policy which is based on equally shared liberty and equality, on no-interference and co-existence principles, and which will be made practicable by the destruction of political and racial barriers and more particularly of the barriers created by suspicion and mistrust.
There is another way Cambodia would like to contribute to this conference and it is that which results from her present case, which might be used to test the practicability and the possibility of accomplishment of the aims laid down at this conference.
Independent and neutral Cambodia now finds herself on the separating line of two civilizations, of two races, of two political worlds ...... and as such, has the dangerous privilege of standing the test and the application of the principles of the Pancha Shila.

My country has adopted these principles and wishes to apply them to the fullest extent. In so doing, she only requests an absolute reciprocity. She requests that her independence, her integrity, her security, her traditions and political ideology be not threatened.
Looking forward to this, Cambodia, through my voice, will express her conviction of the beneficient issue of this conference and her faith in its most important contribution towards the liberty, equality, welfare and, above all, the peace among all peoples.",address,,"Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia",,Opening
"We meet today on an historic occasion. A critical juncture has arrived not only in the history of the AfroAsian region but in the history of mankind, Not merely those nations now menaced by the immediate threat of war, but with them, and because of them, the entire human race stands on the brink of chaos, ready at the least miscalculation or lapse of vigilance to plunge for into the abyss. The Great Powers who within recent

generations have guided the destinies of mankind have brought themselves and us to this calamitous pass. The danger destruction is in fact nothing less than the total of the of that collective civilisation which the nations world have laboured over the centuries to produce nothing less than the complete annihilation of mankind. If this danger is to be averted, it is clear that what is wanted is a shift of emphasis, a change of heart, in

the methods whereby the statesmen and leaders of today are trying to preserve what remains of world peace. The pass to which humanity has been brought by the domination and doctrine of force is the most vivid demonstration of the bankruptcy of force. Of what advantage iS it to hold sway over vast territories, to have at one's command innumerable armies, to be able at the touch of a button to unleash the deadliest weapons science can invent, if, with all this, we are unable to rid ourselves of fear and hysteria and despair ?

The nations on whom the responsibility has hitherto devolved of preserving the world's present armed truce, or planning its future peace, are at a loss. They are hag-ridden by the demon of progress, the monsters their scientists have created. Neither their science nor their statesmanship can afford them any protection.

Their diplomacy has failed in its efforts to devise machinery for the limitaton of armaments by mutual consent or to set up an acceptable international authority for the inspection and supervision of nuclear weapons. In these urgent and vital tasks, where the wisdom of the West has failed, is it possible that the nations of Asia and Africa can hope to succeed? I think it is. Have the nations of this region in fact anything to offer ? I think they have. Has the time come to offer it ? I think it has. I say, then, in all seriousness and in all humility that the peoples of this region have it in their power to apply to the problems of the present day world, and for the first time in recent history, that traditional respect for the spiritual values of life and for the dignity of the human personality which is the distinguishing feature of all their great religions.

We of Asia and Africa have a common interest in peace, and a common desire to achieve it, though some of us differ as to how it should be done. Not one country in this whole region manufactures nuclear weapons; most of them are ill equipped even with the conventional implements of war that date from the preatomic age. When the great powers of the West talk peace, their chances of agreement are weakened by the fact that each suspects the other's strength. We by contrast come to the conference table weak and relatively unarmed. We have no thermonuclear bombs in our pockets, no weapons of chemical or bacteriological warfare up our sleeves, no plans for armament factories Or blueprints for ever more deadly methods of genocide in our briefcases.

A few months hence the Charter of the United Nations is due to come up for revision. The countries of Asia and Africa will then have an historic opportunity to demand that the U.N.O be reconstructed so that it can be in fact what it was intended to be-in theory

an effective instrument of peace, and not merely a forum for the wrangling of opposed power groups.
Now, ten years after the United Nations was founded, the wartime alliance has broken up into two hostile camps Which themselves threaten the peace they were intended to safeguard. They are both armed with the most terrifying weapons of destruction that man has ever possessed and they seem more likely to use them to annihilate the world than to preserve its peace. It is not the United Nations which has preserved the uneasy peace of the last decade. In all the major issues of world politics, such settlements have had to be carried on outside the framework of the United Nations. And the new Asia and Africa can justly take pride in the not unimportant role that some of the nations of this region have played in helping to bring these settlements about.

The time has gone by when the function of small countries in world affairs could be summed up by the words used by one of the war leaders at Yalta, ""The eagle should permit the small birds 10 sing and care not whereof they sing."" Today, on the contrary, the salvation of the world depends not on the great powers but on the lesser countries, many of whom are still voiceless in the councils of the nations. And I am sure that if Asia and Africa put forward an unambiguous and united demand for the reconstitution of the United Nations, by abolishing the Veto and converting the Security Council into a fully elected body responsible to the General Assembly, it will meet with powerful response from all the smaller nations of the world.

The Asian and African countries, if they stand together, can unquestionably make their voice heard for world peace. But the rest of the world will not listen to us unless we are ourselves united in goodwill and free from mutual conflicts. We have to prove by example to other nations that our own international disputes can be settled without resort to force. This conference will be missing a great opportunity if, before we part, we do not pledge ourselves, solemnly and wholeheartedly, to abjure war as a means of settling differences, to resolve all disputes by peaceful negotiation and to abstain from any form of interference in each other's internal affairs.

We, the nations of the new Asia and Africa, whatever our language, whatever our faith, whatever our form of government, whatever the colour of our skins black, brown or yellow have one thing common: we are all poor and underdeveloped. Centuries of servitude and stagnation have left their mark, a dire heritage of poverty and ignorance, upon the masses of our peoples. All our ideologies and religions urge us, in the name of social justice and human compassion, to rid our countries of this evil of poverty. They demand of us that we should do it, also in the name of peace.",address,,"Sir John Kotelawala, Ceylon",,Opening
"of inseAll over the world there is a growing sense the curity.
The fear of war has been aggravated by development of mass-destructive weapons capable of effecting total annihilation. The stakes are high in terms of the very survival of mankind. The challenge is great, the greatest and likely the last. Can the statesmen of the world meet the challenge ? Never before as at present was there a desperate need for an effective international order, and genuine desire on the part of all the peoples of the world to combine their common efforts in bringing this through. Can we cope with this desperate need and We can earn translate such aspirations into a reality ?
DO greater distinction than to seek and work for a true world peace.

To achieve this noble objective, it seems that five conditions are essential the first is the success of the efforts which the United Nations have been making for the regulation, limitation and reduction of all armed forces and armaments; also for the elimination of massdestructive weapons. It is with a painful awareness of the extremely heavy burden of armaments which is tendIng to break the back of the world economy and is distressingly hampering social progress in the world, that Egypt, and I trust all countries represented here and even other countries not represented here, ardently hope that a stop be rapidly made to this race of armaments and that the world will soon awake from the horrifying nightmare which it causes.
Furthermore there is close connection between raising the standard of living of the peoples and decreasing the armaments burden.

It is also evident that modern science and technology, if utilized for peaceful purposes offer the possibility of greater well-being for the human race than has ever been known. Put to peaceful uses, atomic energy offers hitherto undreamed-of opportunities, especially for that vast majority of humanity that is still living in poverty and want in the economically under-developed areas of the world. The second condition for world peace is the adherence by the United Nations to the charter and its principles. All decisions and actions taken by the world organization must be based on the charter. Had this been the case the flagrant injustice inflicted upon the people of Palestine and the unprecedented aggression committed against them would not have taken place. Permit me to make but a few remarks on a subject which involves my deep regret. Under the eyes of the United Nations and with her help and sanction, the people of Palestine were uprooted and expelled from their fatherland, to be replaced by a completely imported populace.

has there been such a brutal Never before in history human principles. and immoral violation of there any guarantee for for the small nations that the big powers who took part in this tragedy would not allow themselves to repeat it again, against another innocent and helpless people ?
It is almost impossible to believe that such injustice could exist in the twentieth century, the age of world order, and under the eyes of the United Nations, the guardian of international law and justice.

No less important as a condition for a world peace iS the full respect of all states of their international obligations. Under the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights the treatment by any state of any national or ethnic group has ceased to be a matter of domestic jurisdiction as certain states still advocate. It has become a question of international jurisdiction and a matter of world concern. Discrimination in any of its forms does not only constitute violation of state obligations, it impairs friendly relations among nations. It is regrettable that racial discrimination is still practised In South Africa. This attitude was described by the United Nations commission on the racial situation in the United of South Africa in the folowing terms: ""The doctrine of racial superiority on which the apartheid policy was based is scientifically false, extremely dangerous tO international peace and security, and contrary to the dignity and worth of the human person.

There is another condition to which I like to make reference and which is usually overlooked especially by some of the big powers. The game of power politics In which the small nations can be used as tools must be stopped if the existing international tension is to come to an end.
The imposition by the big powers of certain policies for the sake of their selfish interest has the damaging effect of isolating the small nations and weakening the ties of unity and community of interests existing between them. thus causing them to fall under the grip of foreign domination.
Small nations are entitled and bound to play independently their constructive role in improving international relations and easing international tension.
Last, but which not least, is the liquidation of colonialism has always been a source of friction and unrest.
Since the days of colonial expansion, the problem of

colonial rule by alien powers has lain al the roots of many wars,
We have been witnessing for some years the rising tide of nationalism not only in our part of the world but also in various parts of Asia and Africa. Our own experience shows us that nationalism when thwarted creates difficult problems; but is dealt with wisely and realistically; it responds with friendship and generosity. We greatly hope that this will be borne in mind in dealing with those remaining areas of the world where the natural urge of nationalism has not yet been satisfied. I hardly need to emphasize the fact that we live now in a difficult age and that the peoples have awakened and nothing can stem the tide of nationalism and progress. On what grounds can any one condone the fact that the countries of North Africa which, for centuries, were independent nations and the seats of great civilizations, are now being degraded to the status of non-self-governing territories? Are such policies conducive to peace and co-operation among nations? Most of the calamities of wars and conflagrations which have brought untold SOTTOW to mankind were

always due to the fact that the right decisions were not taken at the right time.
To stay lagging behind the pressing events; to ignore

and disregard the urgent need for readjustment to the new era which was initiated in 1945, and the dictates of human progress; LO oppose the laws and forces of dynamic change and reformation, is harmful, not only to those who commit these errors, but also to humanity. Here lies one of the main causes of world unrest.
The co-operation we have come cagerly here to promote can never attain its full and effective ends unless we all believe in the fulfilment of the following fundamental principles:
First: every country has the duty to respect the political independence and territorial integrity of every other country and also to refrain from intervention in the affairs of other countries.
Second: every country has the right to choose freely its political as well as economic systems.

Guided by purposes and principles our conference can no doubt reach agreement on such concrete proposals and practical steps as may make it possible to have a standing machinery for putting into effect the co-operation among our countries in the cultural, economic and social fields.",address,,"Lt.

"I bring you cordial greetings and felicitations from my Prime Minister, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, and the people of the Gold Coast on this eventful occasion. Dr. Nkrumah has asked me to express his profound regret at his inability to participate personally in this historic conference. He hopes, however, that success will attend the conference and that the seeds which are sown here at Bandung will bear good fruit for the peace and happiness of our peoples and of the whole world.

Although in our present transitional stage toward nationhood we are not yet responsible for our external affairs, nevertheless we were, on the receipt of the invitation, most anxious not to miss the unique opportunity of being represented at this epoch-making conference. Many of the questions which will be discussed here are matters in which we have a natural and legitimate interest; colonialism and racialism we have never ceased to denounce; world peace and happiness we all desire. However, because of the reasons already mentioned, our delegation attends this conference mainly as observers.
The Government headed by Dr. Nkrumah is pledged to achieve independence for our country within the term of office of our present Parliament, and plans for the

assumption of independence are well under way. Discussions between the United Kingdom Government and ourselves have been marked by statesmanship and cordiality on both sides, and we hope that soon it will be possible to make an announcement declaring the actual date when full sovereignty and independence will be transferred to the Government and people of the Gold
Coast.
The transitional problems which face us In our country today are, however, immense, some of them very challenging. We are nevertheless consumed by the will to conquer, and we dare not fail. Failure in the Gold Coast would be a disastrous blow to the hopes and aspirations of countless millions in Africa and elsewhere struggling to be free.

A new spirit stirs Africa to activity and the Continent is shaking itself like a giant from sleep, fresh with the strength that follows rest. Let us all therefore work together for a newer and happier world in which all of us shall be free to live as men.

Delegation is very happy indeed to be in this beautiful country of Indonesia and to enjoy the hospitality and grace with which the Indonesian people and Government have received us.
In other words, we peoples of Africa and Asia, while benefiting from the fruits of modern science, practical efficiency and organization which are so well advanced in Europe and America, should not lose sight of our higher spiritual values and cultural heritage. We must see to it that a wellbalanced civilization for all mankind shall develop whereby the fruits of the thinking of both orient a and occident shall integrate and that we shall have human civilization, well integrated and harmonious in its composing elements. Integration and harmony between

matter and spirit, between science, art and religion, be-) tween individuals and groups within each nation, and between the nations of the world, should be our guiding principles. To achieve this, we. surely need peace. To achieve peace, we must fortify and strengthen the United Nations Organisation which, in spite of its many good achievements, has not been strong enough to put into practice its ideals and to implement its many resolutions. As far as my country is concerned, we feel that there are three international forces in the world today that disturb peace and harmony and that need to be dealt with with realism and determination. The first is what we might call old-time colonialism which has been gradually crumbling since the end of World War I.

Unfortunately, colonialism IS still well entrenched in many parts of the world. The people of North
Africa, including those of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, and no amount of local are still under the French yoke, influence the French sacrifices and world opinion seems to to move more rapidly in recognizing the rights of these people to independence and freedom.
A typical example of old outworn colonial policy is shown in South Africa where colour prejudice and superiority of the white man has led to discrimination against the Indians and the natives, and to the segregation of the so-called coloured people.

It iS our sincere hope that this Conference will prove in a very modest way to be a great moral force of ideological disarmament and moral rearmament, and that it will inspire the nations gathered here to become active participants in serving the aims and ideals of the

"We represent not only more than half the peoples of the world, but also, those among whom social and political movements have been particularly accelerated. It is in our part of the world that, since the war, the movement for independence has known its greatest development. Notwithstanding this, it is still in the same region that are to be found, today, ninety-seven per cent of colonial peoples and territories. We have all suffered from colonialist ambitions.
I apply the expression ""colonialism"" to include also those territories subjected to the trusteeship regime. Ethiopia has always supported every proposition for fixing the earliest date possible for the freedom of every territory from a colonial or trusteeship regime, as for example, as regards the territory neighbouring Ethiopia today subjected to the trusteeship of that same Power which had so long administered it as a colony.

The similarity, and indeed the diversity of races, languages and religions should make a brotherhood of us all where all forms of fanaticism, racial or religious, are rigorously excluded. Too often we have failed to manifest to the world this community of ideas which inspire us all. It is to the degree that we ourselves demonstrate tolerance, that our claims for equality of races and religions in the other parts of the world can receive, at the United Nations and elsewhere, the consideration that they merit.
Gentlemen, the world finds itself at a turning point in history. We the Asian-African countries, have a unique role to play. We find ourselves between two opposing worlds. Indeed, it is we, more than most, who, since the most remote times of with history, have had to live intimately divergent character and who have groups of languages, races and religions of the most had to cherish the sentiment of tolerance as a condition of national life.

Tolerance must be everything or nothing. It cannot be applied by half measures. It must constitute a universal principle. Consequently, our role to conciliate cannot be achieved if we limit ourselves to particularist concepts. It is only to the extent that we, ourselves, demonstrate the spirit of comprehension of the universal problems confronting the world today, that we can hope to achieve the aims which lie closest to our hearts.
Ethiopia who certainly has had a direct experience and knowledge of the system of collective security on a world-

wide basis and who has, on the other hand, by every means within her power, from the days of the League of Nations to the-present hour, supported that system, remains more than ever convinced that it is only an unwavering loyalty in act and in word to the common obligation to afford the security of collective action to all peoples, that the world can hope to establish a new era of peace and of loyal fruitful collaboration between the peoples of all races. and religions in all parts of the world.",address,,"Ato Aklilou Habtewold, Ethiopia",,Opening
"This Conference is an event unparalleled in the annals of mankind. In fact, it is eminently symbolic of the spirit of Asian-African renaissance. The Japanese Government being fully aware of the importance of this Conference, our Prime Minister was anxious to attend. Unfortunately, owing to the Diet now in session which requires his constant attendance, I have come to take his place. I bring to you all the cordial greetings of Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Ichiro Hatoyama, and his best wishes for the success of this Conference.

It affords me a great pleasure to take part in this momentous Conference and state the hopes and aspirations of the Japanese people as a member of the Asian-African region.
Japan as one of Asiatic nations whose destiny is identical with that of Asia cannot but attach the greatest importance to this Conference.
It would be trite to say that the Asian-African region is the cradle of world civilization. The glorious traditions of our past constitute part and parcel of the contemporary civilization, and they do form the life-blood that throbs within us. As such, these are the foundation of the sense of racial kinship among the Asian-African peoples. In spite, however, of the fact that these races are the pioneers of civilization, and they are possessed of abundant human and material resources, they have fallen behind in economic, and technological development. We should, I think, recognize this fact and should achieve genuine independence and progress through self-help and mutual cooperation.

I hope this Conference will light the beacon of AsianAfrican renaissance and that we will once again raise high the torch-light of our indigenous civilization.

In World War II, Japan, I regret to say, inflicted damages upon her neighbour nations, but ended by bringing untold miseries upon herself. She has reestablished democracy, having learned her lesson at immense costs in lives and property. Chastened and free, she is today a nation completely dedicated to peace. As the only people who have experienced the horrors of atomic bomb, we have no illusion whatever about the enormity of an attempt to solve international disputes by force. Consequently, it has become our immutable policy to establish firmly peaceful democracy at home.
The present Conference, by promoting mutual understanding and neighbourly amity among the AsianAfrican countries, can contribute vastly to world peace and, at the same time, accelerate the economic progress of their entire region.

In the light of the foregoing statement, the Japanese delegation will submit to the Conference certain proposals on economic and cultural cooperation together with a proposal for the maintenance of international peace. I request that these be given careful consideration by the honorable delegates.
The world is now entering upon the age of nuclear energy. Whether nuclear energy is to become a deadly instrument of destruction that will extinguish the human race, or it is turned to peaceful uses to bestow infinite benefits on mankind, will depend solely upon the intelligence of man. The proper choice is possible only on a high plane spiritual and cultural. It is time, I believe, We the peoples of the Asian-African region went to work together to build the edifice for permanent peace, on a foundation of the moral and spititual values handed down to them from the ages past.",address,,"Tatsunosuke Takasaki, Japan",,

Conference.
THE AGENDA
It was decided that the agenda for consideration by the Conference be defined under five separate headings: Economic Co-operation Cultural Co-operation Human Rights and Self-determination Problems of Dependent Peoples World Peace and Co-operation.

Ways and means of dealing efficiently with the wide scope of the agenda were also discussed, and led to the following decisions.

Nothing will be considered to be a decision of the Conference unless it meets with unanimous approval. That is to say, the Conference will be free to discuss and exchange views upon any matter it may desire, bringing forwards suggestions which might perhaps be suitable for decision at a later stage. But any point which was not decided upon unanimously would be understood not to have the power of a decision.",general,,,,
"THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA
In Bandung not only a conference will be opened, in Bandung-a new period in the history of the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries will be opened. For the first time in history the representatives of 29 countries representing more than half of mankind will meet to decide upon their OWn destinies and their own future. Since ages their fates have been ""decided"" by non
Asian and non-African hands.
This conference now taking place is of extreme importance, Not because this conference except for the

League of Nations and the UNO. is the biggest ever known in history, but because this Bandung conference is a landmark that alters the course of history; the destiny of Asia and Africa from now on will be decided by and in Asia and Africa.
From this it can be explained why the significance of April 18 cannot be measured in terms of days, months or years ; April 18 will put its mark for ages.
It is quite easy to understand why the colonialists are loath to see this Asian-African awakening. It is also understandable that they will utilise all means possible to wreck this historic conference.
At first they maintained that it was an impossibility that twenty nine countries should meet and they referred to the fact that Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines had

already joined Seato. But the fact that the Bandung conference iS in progress and is also attended by Thailand, the Philippines and others, is a living proof that the desire for Asian-African co-operation is stronger than the wish to be enemies, that the desire to unite is stronger than the wish to dispute.
They furthermore alleged that the different levels of development and the differences in state systems, religions and convictions would make it impossible for the Asian and African peoples to get together. For the colonialists whose principal weapon is divide et impera, differences are indeed of far greater importance than similarities. But it is impossible for the colonialists to neglect the reality that however the twenty-nine countries may differ in various aspects, they do not differ in one question they all want peace and wish to develop their countries.

It is at this direction that all the work and activities of the present Bandung conference are aimed. The Optimism and the certitude shown by the participating delegations testify to the fact that this conference will not be in vain but on the contrary shall realise its aim.

"THE A-A CONFERENCE
This Bandung conference is of unprecedented importance in history and Indonesia feels proud that it can be host to this epoch-making gathering.
What dare we hope from this conference ? It is obvious that this conference cannot come with clear cut and strong worded resulitions. The effects of the cold war will certainly make themselves felt at the conference and some fierce debates will most likely turn up. Nevertheless, these debates are highly appreciated as long as no party attem'pts to make this conference a springboard for propaganda. Some frank discussions on the most urgent problem which confronts Asia today would certainly be most useful. The possibility of preserving peace in Asia should become the most important topic of discussions.

We have stated on Saturday that this conference stands a good chance of winning peace in Asia as long as the participant nations can put aside their differences and try to seek the common ties which may establish their solidarity. With this the area of peace can be extended in the world so that the danger of war will be lessened.
It is in this field where the conference can hope to make its most valuable contribution and we hope that will achieve this objective.

"ASIAN-AFRICAN EXPECTATIONS
(by Surveyer)
For sponsors and critics alike, the forthcoming AsianAfrican Conference has acquired something of the character of a big event of the season. Even those to whom any such conference not sponsored by the Western Powers is automatically suspect, have acknowledged in various ways that the conclusions of the Bandung meeting will almost certainly have a vital bearing on international affairs. It was clearly some appreciation of this that ""cordial greetings"" to the Asian-African delegates. A similar consideration appears to have been responsible for Thailand's sudden decision in reversal of its earlier attitude to participate in the conference.
Unobjectionable.

There is nothing objectionable in the view that nonneutral Asian Powers such as those that have accepted Seato commitments should attend the Bandung conference in an attempt to modify the policies of _the non-aligned Asian Powers. A conference of the sort which the Colombo Powers have in mind cannot in any sense be exclusive, and the more hospitable it is to various and even conflicting points of view, the better it will serve its purpose as a clearing house of ideas and policies designed to ease international tension. With Japan, Thailand and Pakistan as well as the Middle Eastern countries fully represented at Bandung, there will be no question of an uncritical acceptance of all the principles and policies favoured by the Colombo Powers.

This is not to say that there is likely to be any serious opposition to the Pancha Shila or that the principle of non-alignment will be effectively disputed. What is hoped for is that as in the British Commonwealth despite differences of approach of assessment a general sense of the meeting will emerge to enable the Asian-African Powers to play a more influential role in world affairs. It is easier to specify what the conference should not be rather than to define its objectives. Obviously there is an impression, particularly in the United States, that there is to be a sort of ""ganging up"" of the Asian-African powers in an attempt to offset Seato and provide the machinery for an anti-colonial campaign.

Some of the participants at Bandung are likely to have similar ideas unless it is made clear in good time that the meeting is not intended in any way to be ""agitational."" The ventilation of grievances, particularly against the Western Powers, is no way to conduct constructive policies and would merely add to international tension and misunderstanding. Something more positive and substantial is expected of a conference so comprehensive and unique. Since its members will include-Cummunist China, Japan,

the Arab States, the Gold Coast and even the Central African Federation, it can hardly deteriorate into a socalled ""third bloc."" Nor can racialism a negative and profitless approach to world affairs dominate a meeting of this kind.
Whether any acceptable programme can result from a mecting of States covering SO large an area as the Asian and African continents is doubtful. It would certainly be too much to expect vigorous and positive policies to result. But policies are not the vital need. More important is the need to identify the Asian-African Powers with an approach to world affairs that accepts international peace asthe primary objective, not cold war advantages or ideological victories
(The Times of India, March 28, 1955).",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"Because of the divergence in the point of view of the participating countries, large areas of agreement on concrete problems cannot be reasonably expected. In exploiting the resentment against colonialism and imperialism of peoples who have only recently gained independence, the Asian-African Conference will furnish a convenient point of departure for the propaganda of the puppet Piping Communist regime.
Instead of creating better understanding among the participating countries, the struggle for leadership in the conference and subsequent to it may cause some trouble. If India would try to insinuate herself into the better graces of the Arab countries, she would not be improving her relations with either Egypt or Pakistan. Should India let Piping have too great a hold on the conference, Nehru would be jeopardizing his own position of preeminence. Vice versa, Piping could not be expected to play second fiddle.

The philosophy of the proposed conference cannot be divorced from the desire of India to play ""Follow the Leader"" with the other youngsters of the neighborhood with herself as leader. The leadership of India is essentially in the hands of Nehru. A generation ago, Nehru wrote: ""Much in Soviet Russia I dislike the ruthless suppression of all contrary opinion, the wholesale regimentation, the unnecessary violence but there is no lack of violence in the capitalistic world."" In the final analysis, Communist violence is to be preferred, for ""violence was common in both places, but the violence of the capitalist order seemed inherent in it, whilst the violence in Russia, bad though it was, aimed at a new order based on peace and cooperation and real freedom for the masses."" seems
Such are still Jawaharlal Nehru's views. Such to be the philosophy underlying the proposed Bandung

"WEST WILL HAVE FRIENDS AT
ASIA-PARLEY
By Chalmers M. Roberts
Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru the other day described the Asian-African Conference which opens at Bandung, Indonesia, as ""essentially an experiment in co-existence"".
The evidence is beginning to pile up that the ""experiment"" is going to be one of the most fascinating in recent years and that the results are likely to be of great importance in today's global conflict between freedom and communism.

Ready to speak. Semantically speaking, the conference may not 'discuss"" freedom vs. communism. But evidence is beginning to appear that the conference is not just going to pass resolutions opposing colonialism, imperialism and racial discrimination and favoring peaceful co-existence. There is very likely going to be a real effort to speak up and be heard of the nations which most palpably feel the hot breath of communism on their necks. There is a solid piece of public evidence for this view, a completely overlooked statement issued on the last day of the recent Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ministers from the United conference at Bangkok. That was the meeting of foreign
States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, land.
Pakistan, the Philippines and Thai-

The statement noted that the last three named would also be at Bandung. It said that the Seato Council asked those Asian members of the Council ""accordingly to transmit cordial greetings to the other free countries and to express the hope that out of their conference at Bandung would come increased assurance that the free nations would remain free and that all peoples would come increasingly to enjoy, in peace, the blessing of liberty.
•*The Council also invited a broad sharing of their dedication, expressed in the Pacific Charter, to uphold the principle. of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and to promote self-government and to secure the Independence of all countries whose people desire it and are able to undertake its responsiblities"".

This statement is a clear outline of the task which those nations at Bandung most closely associated with the United States are going to take in April. Adherence to such a course is expected from such varied countries as Japan, South Vietnam, Cambodia, Turkey, Ethiopia, Liberia and some of the Arab states in all, a formidable number of the 30 invitees.
Just how much preconference consultation has been going on among these nations is hard to say. But there are good reasons to feel the Bangkok statement can safely be taken as the head of the iceberg.
The idea of the Bandung conference originally revolved around economic, and cultural matters. But it was Nehru who put over the conference last December after

his trip to Peiping. It seems reasonably clear that his idea was that the conference would be a good opportunity to demonstrate his theory that Red China should be accepted by the world community and thus be subject to its rules, such as they are.
This was clearly to Peiping's liking. Premier Chou En-lai, who is expected personally at Bandung, said in announcing Red China's acceptance that the conference ""reflects the ever stronger desire of Asian and African countries to take their destiny into their own hands and to enter on an equal footing into friendly cooperation with the other countries of the world.""

""'The main enslaver"". All of this set the scene for Chou to produce at Bandung the Big Bad Wolf of Asia the United States. Moscow has openly indicated the Communist line in a Pravda editorial headed, 'Against Imperialist Oppression. Pravda declared that ""American Imperialism, acting the part of the main gendarme and enslaver of the colonial peoples, is attempting in every way to thwart the great process of the renaissance of the peoples of the East."" Piping Radio has been full of the same.
Perhaps a middle position was best expressed by the Prime Minister of Ceylon, Sir John Kotelawala, when he said ""Moscow and Washington must realize that there are others, too, in the world and that the main concern of these others is peace.""

"ASIAN-AFRICAN CONFERENCE* Although it may be questionable whether the twentyfive countries invited to attend the Afro-Asian Conference in Indonesia in April have enough in common to achieve any positive result, the purpose of their meeting, even it is not couched in the clearest terms, is significant. The five Asian powers who have sent out the invitations India, Pakistan, Burma, Ceylon and Indonesia must consider their uncommitted position in world affairs to be positive enough to appeal, under the heading of ""mutual as well as common interests, to countries as far apart as Japan and the Gold Coast.

There has been a noticeable feeling among Asian leaders for some time that world policies are the result of western thinking, both from inside the United Nations and out of it. This western dominance not only adds to the general feeling of affront, but it offers no solution for the common problems, economic and political, which face the countries of the area. There is a common approach among the countries of the East tO certain problems, and there is no doubt that Middle Eastern and African countries view their problems in a similar perspective.

One of the surest facts they will find when they take stock of their position is that on the economic plane they have A great deal in common. for all of the countries invited, except Japan, are beginning, or will shortly begin, to move into stage of industrial development. To achieve this smoothly and rapidly, as India has so often made clear, it vitally necessary to avoid involvement in the issues which create tension between western democracy and Communism. The whole question of economic aid from the West, and chiefly from the United States, has created suspicions among the Asians that its acceptance would possibly commit them in some small way to support of the donor's policies. The Colombo Plan is acceptable because of its emphasis on mutual and self-help. There has been no great enthusiasm for the proposed American ""Marshall Plan for Asia,"" and it 18 possible that in the minds of many Asians there hope that the coming Afro-Asian Conference will gO some way towards finding solution to economie problems within the framework of cooperation.

That there is desire among the countries of Asia to be unencumbered by obligatory economic ties with the

West cannot be denied, but whether the desire will be felt as strongly by the Middle Eastern and African coun tries is not certain. But they must in general trems, feel much the same about political and economie relations with Europe and America the Asian countries do, because had it been: otherwise the five Prime Ministers could not have talked at Bogor so assuredly of common interests.

No one can say m this carly stage whether the conference in April will be successful, or if it will achieve anything at all. There is no question, apparently, of its being regarded 08 kind of regional United Nations. Whatever way it regarded it regrettable that neither Malaya nor Israel was invited. Both come within the purview of the invitation. Malaya was apparently regarded 118 100 much of a colonial administratio to be represented, but, with the elections pending, it might at least have been courteous to invite some prominent political Malayan lenders like Sir Cheng-lock T'an and Tunku Abdul Rahman AS observers; after all, the Central African Federation has been asked to attend. The ignoring of Israel is less defensible. Her economic problems and most of her political ones in the global context are similar to the other invited countries. It is, of course, obvious that had she been asked to attend the Arab countries would have refused, but this very factor undermines the emphasis lnid upon the promotion of pence. This is the danger

implicit in bringing an intangible-idea down to practical levels and widening its scope national rivalries become apparent, and they weaken the purpose. The important feature is that China has been asked to attend, and it may well be that Mr. Mohammed Ali agreed to China's invitation only if Mr. Nehru and U Nu would cease to press (as it is known that they did) for the inclusion of
Israel.
It will be n big conference, and a little unwieldy, | all 25 countries attend, but it has great possibilities. Apart from economic questions it seems Apparent that the Indian theory of dynamic neutralism will be the dominant theme, and, if China can be persuaded to see the sense in other countries adopting it 08 would those countries foreign policy, what have to lose by doing 80 ? By being committed to either side, the countries of Asia, Africa and the Middle East will not achieve satisfactory national progress. Neutralism could be the plus economic co-operation long term answer to their problems.

"Message from Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala to the Asian-African Conference Bulletin

There are many thoughts that cross my mind as write this message for the Bulletin of the Asian-African Conference. I feel a sense of elation that this Conference has become 8 reality, that a new era is about to begin in the history of Asian-African relations. But we are meeting in difficult times, and for this reason I have some anxiety about the future. We, Eastern nations, have, so tO speak. been reborn a divided world. We have to find our places among the other nations and our task is made difficult by the tensions all around us that threaten to endanger our very survival.
Among the problems that face us, undoubtedly the most pressing is the economic development of our countries. For many centuries our people have been compelled to be satisfied with small mercies, while the rich resources of our lands have gone 10 benefit others. But this state of affairs is now at an end. We are free and are

the masters of our own destinies. Freedom alone is, however, no panacea for our ills. We have to rebuild the traditions of our lost civilizations, and we have to infuse in our people a will to better themselves. The road ahead is by no means easy but I am confident that we shall not falter,
The first requirement of all our countries, if We are to progress, is period of undisturbed peace and peace in our time has become a very uncertain thing. But there can be no peace without international understanding. The principal task of the leaders gathered at Bandung is therefore the establishment of confidence and understanding among themselves. If we can make the slightest contribution towards creating an arca of understanding in Asia and Africa, we shall have justified our meeting.",general,,"Sir John Kotelawala, Ceylon",,
"On the threshold of this conference let us not forget that the world is observing and judging us. Let us not forget that on our work depends the well-being and may be the salvation of numerous peoples and the first thought, which, I believe, should dominate these debates, is that of Human brotherhood.
In fact, regardless of the distance or the opinion Or the culture which differentiates the peoples here represented we are all or which separate them from those absent,

united here by the ties of this brotherhood. Therefore the value of the service which the leaders of every nation may render to their country and to the world is proportional to their efforts to bring together peoples and to insure for individuals lodging, clothing and food.
However, three obstacles impede this idea, hinder the success of our meetings and enterprise to may compromise the noble which, gentlemen, you have today linked your name. These dangers are first, fanaticism in all its forms,

second, chauvinism or overpushed nationalism. and third hatred of foreigners.
These are, without doubt, seeds for discord and division. These are the enemies of peace and of humanity. If human rights, as defined by the Charter of the United Nations, are sacred, the right of nations themselves, no matter how small, to the respect of greater nations is at least just as sacred. Furthermore, the oppressed peoples, those who have not yet enjoyed freedom and independence as well as those who have been deprived of both will find here, we hope, the best support.
Deeply convinced, on the other hand, of the existence of a fundamental justice and imbued with the principle

of democratic freedoms, we believe of men that it iS through safe-guarding faith in the spiritual destinies of men that _we would ameliorate their fate and it is by encouraging such policy that this Assembly would have accomplished its mission.
After all it is through tolerance that we will settle permanently our difficulties and that we will impose our respect on the world. It is through tolerance that we will create an atmosphere favourable to international collaboration. Finally it is through tolerance that we will appease passions, which unfortunately have been for so long nourished, and which if unchained, would lead uS to disaster.",address,,"Sami Solh, Lebanon",,Opening

"My country is of the opinion that the present tension in world relations is due to a number of evils evils which must be won if humanity wishes to live in harmony, and if world peace is at all to be safeguarded. Most countries have realized long ago where the danger lies. Their efforts to fight it, however, have been too slow. I am referring to Firstly: COLONIALISM. Mankind has been able to free itself from individual slavery, but, alas, it is still

suffering in many parts of the world from nation slavery, the subjugation of an entire people.
It is also very regrettable that France, the first nation to proclaim the principles of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, should meet the rightful claims of these three countries to freedom and independence, with violence and repression. We sincerely hope, however, that France will reconsider her attitude, and stop bloodshed, and answer the aspirations of the people of North Africa.

Secondly
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, whether based on colour or origin, is an evil derived from the offence to humanity. colonial spirit and it is indeed a great Thirdly : EXTERNAL IDEOLOGICAL INTERFERENCE. We all agree that every country has a perfect she wishes right to choose for itself whatever ideology the world as a whole, that to, but It is very dangerous for any country should attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, and to force upon her, whether of openly or secretly, a different way of life or system government.
Such interference, whatever its source might be, iS but another kind of colonialism more dangerous and of much stronger effect, since it embodies all the disadvantages of colossal colonialism, and, in addition, intellectual slavery. It is a danger menacing the sovereignty of nations, and the cause of world peace.

I shall conclude by saying that the United Kingdom of Libya firmly believes in the institutions of Democracy, and in the principles proclaimed by the Charter of the United Nations, and sees in them the only means to ensure for all peoples on earth, peace and security. For these reasons the Libyan people and its Government are against colonialism, whatever its kind or source may be, as well as against racial discrimination, and external ideological interference. It furthermore believes in the desirability of economic cooperation based on equality and common interests, and in the necessity to widen the scope of such cooperation by lessening control over trade.

"It is my earnest hope that our work in this Conference will result not only in promoting understanding among the nations here represented, but will also be of benefit to all nations of the world. The countries of Asia and Africa cannot regard themselves as a group apart. Their problems and their fortunes. are inevitably bound up with those of the rest of the world.
They meet because they find it necessary to come together for promoting goodwill and cooperation among themselves and to exchange views on problems which require their combined attention. They meet also in the conviction that by so doing they may help, in So far as lies in their power, to promote international goodwill and strengthen the fabric of world peace.

I am confident that no nation in the world pays only lip service to justice and that the trend towards the liberation of subject peoples is universal. I believe that imperialism, as we have known it in the past in Asia and Africa, is an anachronism and is well on the road to liquidation. We cannot be complacent however.
We must do everything in our power to ensure that the peoples who are still groaning under the hell of foreign domination, are allowed to enjoy in full measure the fruits of freedom. At the same time we must be very careful that we are not misled into opening our doors to a new and more insidious form of imperialism that masquerades in the guise of liberation.
We shall during this Conference discuss the means whereby the causes of tension between nations may be removed and world peace assured. At the appropriate time I propose to place before you the following seven principles, acceptance of which by all nations is, in my

opinion, essential for the maintenance of peace. These seven principles are

ONE • •
Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.
TWO Recognition of the equality of every independent and sovereign nation.
THREE: Abstention from interference 10 the internal affairs of one country by another.
FOUR Non-aggression against the territorial integrity Or political independence of any country.
FIVE : Right of self-defence exercised singly or collectively.
SIX Right of self-determination of all peoples and abhorrence of colonial exploitation in any shape or form and

SEVEN Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means, namely, negotiations, mediation or arbitration.

It is my conviction that not until these seven principles of peace are universally recognized and resolutely implemented, can existing world tensions be resolved and world peace firmly secured. It would not be enough merely to proclaim our faith in these principles.
It is only when these principles are not only accepted but acted upon by all countries that it will be possible for nations to co-exist in peace, regardless of diversities of race, religion, ideology or form of government.

I look upon these seven principles as the Seven Pillars of Peace. Only when the edifice of peace has been thus securely raised, will fear and mistrust be banished from the hearts of men and it will be possible for all nations freely to maintain and develop friendly relations on the basis of mutual esteem, mutual trust and mutual benefit.
From a willingness to accept these seven principles will stem agreement on reduction and international control of armament.
In our efforts to help strengthen the forces of peace and remove international tensions we will no doubt consider the question of the Palestine refugees and the grant of self-government to Tunisia and Morocco as well as the problem of Algeria when we take up detailed discussion of our agenda.

There is one other matter on the agenda with regard to which I should like to indicate the attitude of my delegation at this stage. We believe firmly in the university of membership of the United Nations. We consider that the more broad-based that organisation is the better it will be In a position to serve mankind.
We consider that all independent countries which have applied for membership of the United Nations and

are eligible should be admitted as members of the body. There may be some difficulties in the way of admitting certain countries in Europe, but we see no reason why the admission of such countries in Asia and Africa to the United Nations should be held up. We consider also that these two vast continents are inadequately represented in the Security Council and would suggest an increase in the non-permanent seats on the Security Council to ensure proper representation of Asian-African nations.

The political crisis of our time creates anxiety in our hearts. But we must remember that peace is not a purely political phenomenon. It IS affected largely by economic, social and moral factors. As the difficulties on the political plane increase, we should lay greater stress on the economic, social and moral values. The real enemies of peace and progress are poverty, disease, ignorance and prejudice. They corrupt and corrode society and breed unrest and hatred. Economic improvement will combat the evils of poverty and disease, and education will dispel ignorance and prejudice. In these days of political anxiety we must intensify our efforts for the economic, social and intellectual improvement of our peoples.",address,,"Mohammed Ali, Pakistan",,Opening
"All who are represented here are certainly concerned with the issues of (1) colonialism and political freedom (2) racial equality, and (3) peaceful economic growth. The history of the world in our time turns on the ways in which these issues are met and resolved, or not met and not resolved.
To begin with, the very fact that we have come together here in this manner illustrates the great new fact that these issues of freedom, equality, and growth are no longer merely national problems but world problems.

In this world of contending great powers, the indepence of the small or meak nation is at best a precarious and fragile thing. Obviously the ultimate greater freedom will lie in a greater coherence, a uniting of regional interests, in the creation of counterbalancing moral, economic, and physical strength, in the greatest possible common action by all to avert the disaster of a new world war. Let us face squarely up to the fact that within the nation we can regain our self-respect and grapple with our local problems but that for the primary goals of economic transformation and well-being and peace, the nation no longer suffices. Western European man today is paying the terrible price for preserving too long the narrow and inadequate instrument of the nation state. Besides the issues of colonialism and political freedom, all of us here are concerned with the matter of racial

equality. This IS a touchstone, I think, for most of us assembled here and the peoples we represent. The systems and the manners of it have varied, but there has not been and there is not a Western colonial regime, which has not imposed, to a greater or lesser degree, on the people it ruled the doctrine of their own racial inferiority.

We all confront the staggering facts of our economic backwardness. This has been partly due to factors of climate, geography, and the stubborn survival of obsolete social patterns. But it has also in large measure and perhaps decisively been the result of patterns imposed upon us by Western colonialism. This heritage is the heaviest burden we carry with us into the new epoch of national freedom. The-great masses of our people live in a state of poverty. We need to diversify our economies. We need to industrialize in accordance with our resources and needs. We have to win a more balanced place in the market places of the world. We have to do this in a manner that will effectively raise the standard of living of our people. These are the things we have fought for. These are the things that some of us here are still fighting for. For these things above all, we have needed to be free to seek our own way

But let us not have too many illusions about national independence. We arrive in the world as nations in the middle of the 20th century, not the 19th or the 18th. In this 20th century world the sober fact is that I

We cannot start centuries ago. purely national economy is an We have where, say, England started two to make our places in 2 world that has already made economic tremendous advances technologically and where inter-dependence has become the key to effective economic development and growth, But this by no means leaves us helpless to act in no choice our own interest. It does not mean that we have but to leave the great decisions to others. Quite the contrary. Quite the contrary, because it is precisely in our lands, in our continents, that the most important decisions are going to be made. And it is we who will make them, by what we do or by what we do NOT do in the coming years.
In could be that Russia's bombs or America's bombs the tate will determine the future shape of the world and of humanity.

If it comes to that the tragedy will be total total: it will make all we say or do here or anywhere else quite irmove relevant. Reason will die and the survivors will as best they can into a new epoch of savagery. But I do not think the great decisious will come that way. I think

Today this type of Western racism survives in virulent form only in certain parts of Africa, notably in the Union of South Africa but certainly in many other places as well on that vast continent. Against this every decent man on earth has to set his face. In the United Nations, the Asian and African states have again and again forced this issue on the unwilling attention of the other members. There we could see palpably the extent to which Western men have had to become defensive about their past racist attitudes. Few of the Western countries were willing to go far enough in condemning the racial practices of the Government of the Union of South Africa. They have yet to learn, it seems, how deeply this issue cutsand how profoundly it unites non-Western peoples who may disagree on all sorts of questions.-",address,,"Carlos P.

"In the battle for peace, first and foremost, we must have faith in our capacity and our potentiality. We are not negligible. It is true we are under-developed in the military and economic fields. It is equally true that we do not possess nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. But still our contribution can be great and decisive. With our combined will, if we earnestly will, we can veto a catastrophic war or bring it down to a minimum. Without us a world war cannot be waged. We command the greatest of man power, of raw material, of war fuel, of military bases and of strategic positions. What a great asset to arrest war and establish peace.
Peace cannot be manufactured. Peace is not a commodity liable to export or import. Peace is the making of a peaceful mind, of a peaceful policy and of a peaceful action. Should a third war be waged, there would be no victors or vanquished, as all will be vanished. Those on the right or on the wrong, those on the offensive or defensive all would be brought to non-existence. This dreadful destiny decrees that peaceful co-existence must be the basic foundation of our international life. It is a fallacy to think of war as a necessity. It IS a great evil to think of war as an unavoidable evil. In this world of ours with the human genius capturing the riches of nature, all human needs can be satisfied. There is ample room for all ideas to be advanced. and enough room for all ideals to be achieved.

Israel does not belong to Asia or Africa. Israel is a pocket left behind the line of imperialism in its desperate retreat. Placed at one of the main gates of Asia, at the cross-roads of the three continents, Israel is an advanced outpost of imperialism. Thus, Israel exposes to danger the liberty of the peoples of Asia and Africa a liberty they captured through their sweat, blood and tears.
Next comes the question of North Africa. The conditions in Morocco, Tunis and Algeria, are distressing and disturbing. Morocco, a State ten centuries old, is now vast concentration camp with a deposed monarch. Tunis is lingering since 1950 in a process of protracted negotiations for its humble autonomy. Algeria is in a state of little war, a recurrence of a century's conflict. In general these three Arab territories, once the seat of dynasties and civilizations, are denied their national aspirations and the exercise of the principle of self-determination.
Africa presents another tragic problem. Racial discrimination against the people of Indian and Pakistan origin and the policy of Apartheid are a source of grave concern and deep anxiety to the whole civilized world. On Asia we have the question of West Irian. This is again a legacy of imperialism. The territory is an integral part of the Republic of Indonesia. It is alarming that the United Nations dealing with this question in its last session has not adopted a resolution framed in the most moderate language.

In all these problems imperialism stands out as the main cause with no other cause.
We trust that our conference will lead to concrete results. The world has become sick of deliberations without tangible outcome. It would be a great disappointment to public opinion if we are to confine ourselves to oratory

as a substitute to constructive measures. We hope, when we gO back to our homes, we will be able to offer our people a list of action rather than a heap of speeches.

"HISTORY IS MADE
A great thing, something taking place for the first time in world history, has become a reality in Bandung with the holding of the Asian-African Conference. Indonesia plays not only an important but also an honourable part in its convening, because she is the initiator of the conference as well as host.
For several days the big political figures of Asia and Africa such as Nehru, Romulo, Chou En-lai, Nasser, Mohammed Ali and U Nu are gathered in Bandung. On their shoulders is laid the task of carrying out measures to maintain world peace as well as to raise the position of the Asian-African nations in the world today and in the future.

For centuries Asian and African nations have been the victims of Western domination. The Bandung conference will seek ways and means to eliminate that domination. The representatives of the twentynine AsianAfrican nations will consider various important problems affecting the peoples of Asia and Africa in particular and the world in general.
The conference in Bandung IS a unique conference in world history, and we hope it will be able to come to a joint declaration that conforms with the aspirations of all the Asian and African peoples. The big political figures of Asia and Africa taking part in the deliberations should put forward new ideas and new ways to eliminate international conflicts and the cold war which exists today. If this can be done, the results of the Con-

ference will represent a valuable and important contribution now and in the future.
The Conference offers an excellent opportunity to the participating countries to create closer relations with one another, and we are convinced that each delegation will make use of this opportunity to sow the seeds of understanding in order to smoothen future relations. Only by close co-operation can the remnants of colonialism be eradicated. and only in this way can the political, economic, social and cultural development of each participating country be achieved.
Indonesia, as the host, should realise the importance of her position and do her utmost to see that the Conference achieve the best possible results results that will not disappoint either the Asian and African nations or the world in general.

"THE WHYS & WHEREFORES OF THE A-A
CONFERENCE
The Asian-African Conference due to meet in Indonesia this summer, is an event of unique significance in the history of Asia. In order to educate public opinion in India and the rest of Asia, where Blitz is widely. read and commented upon, we began last week a new series of articles by leading public figures as to the main issues before the Asian-African Conference and how they can be tackled. This week's contributor is Dr. Rafiq
Zakaria.
The move to call the Asian-African Conference is another successful application of the now famous Nehru Doctrine in international politics.
About three years ago, no one would have dreamt that such a move on such a gigantic scale would ever have materialised. But let it be said to the credit of our Prime Minister that he stood firm by his policy of neutrality and non-alignment with the two power blocs even in the days of India's isolation in world affairs.

Widening the Sphere of Neutrality.
This move, as the sponsors have made it clear, is not directed against any country or group of countries. It is a move in the direction of world peace and progress. True, this move, if successful, will widen the sphere of neutrality and to that extent some powers may not relish it. But we have to look today at the problems of the world, specially in view of the Atom and Hydrogen Bombs, in the larger perspective of the preservation of world peace.
Important Role of Arab Countries.
Viewed thus, it would be clear even to the meanest intelligence that, as our Prime Minister has repeatedly made clear, defence pacts do not lead to any security but on the contrary provoke others to organise themselves into counter-defence pacts with the result that the menace of. war becomes more and more real.
In the Asian-African Conference, I am sure, the Arab countries will play an extremely important role. Today they occupy, not only strategically but also on account of their immense oil resources, a key position in world affairs ; and hence if they are persuaded by the Colombo Powers to take a correct lead it will go a long way In the easing of the world tension.

In this connection the fight that is going on between Egypt on one side and Iraq on the other in the Arab League is of more than local significance. On its outcome will largely depend the contribution that the Arab bloc will make towards the success of the Asian-African Conference

United Stand For World Peace.
The Egyptian Prime Minister, though a military man and yet in his thirties. has proved to be a great statesman and I am sure he will not leave any stone unturned to preserve the Arab unity, of course without sacrificing any of the fundamentals of his stand.
1 am also hopeful that the new King of Saudi Arabia, Saud bin Abdul Aziz, who has already acquired a unique position for himself in the Arab world, will exert all the influence at his command to see that no edge is created in the edifice of Arab security and that the Arabs will come unitedly to the forthcoming Asian-African Conference and help Mr. Nehru in preserving world peace.

"BILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE WILL BE
PRESENT
By Donald Grant
Red China's premier, Chou En-lai and Vietminh's successfull revolutionary, Ho Chi Minh, are expected to use all of the tactics of world Communism, developedin the nearly 30 years since the Russian revolution, to

turn the Asian-African Conference into a cosmic antiAmerican demonstration.
Viewed from the perspective of Washington where high State Department officials newly returned from conference in Asia believe, they say, much of that part of the world is in the process of sliding down into the morass of Communism the issue at Bandung seems to be Will the Asian-African Conference become another way-station on the road to domination by the Moscow-Peiping axis for a billion and a half Asians and Africans ?
But viewed from Asia or Africa, Bandung raises the hope of being a way-station on the road to independent power and economic development the high road to world recognition.
Red China and Vietminh will present the ""'Russian way"" as the most attractive way for the as yet uncommitted nations to modernize their economies and to achieve the status they seek.
The United States will have friends at the conference notably the representatives of the Philippine Republic, whose delegation probably will be headed by Gen. Carlos P. Romulo, Philippine Ambassador to the United States and personal representative in the United States of President Ramon Magsaysay.

Gen. Romulo's position nt Bandung, however, will have not be an enviable one. State Department officials for months been recommending with the greatest urgency that new and massive American program for the econoour mic development of the underdeveloped areas be projected in advance of the Bandung Conference, to give friends there something to talk about.
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles at the Seato Conference earlier this month at Bangkok, Thailand, referred to the Asian-African Conference by stating that ""all of us are working for peace, freedom, justice and well-being and therefore working for a common purpose."" The Seato Conference adopted a resolution of greeting to the AsianAfrican Conference, which will be attended by Seato members, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines.
As of today, the most the State Department hopes for from the Bandung Conference is that Nehru, leader of the uncommitted nations may be able to emerge as the dominant figure. The only visible alternative is outright Communist domination.
There is evidence that Nehru will indeed assert his leadership atthe conference, not only through his friends in Asia, but also through Egypt's strong-arm Premier Gamel Abdul Nasser, with whom Nehru recently has gone. out of his way tO develop cordial relations.

"CONFUSING
With the best will in the world it is difficult to understand what Premier Jawaharlal Nehru expects of the Afrasian conference at Bandung next April.
Doubtless the fault is largely with the abbreviated account of his views on the subject made available over the radiocasts. But from what can be ascertained from such a skimpy source, Mr. Nehru really doesn't expect anything much.
He concedes that all the nations represented are opposed to colonialism, but he adds that the conference IS not expected to bring out any definite program of nction against colonialism. It is possible that since the colonialism to which Mr. Nehru has been accustomed is pretty much of a dead horse, there is no point in kicking it any longer. There is n new colonialism around, of course, but it is expedient at this time to say nothing about it.
He concedes that there are two distinct forces in the world and that among the nations to meet at Bandung

there will be those favoring one or the other, and nations which choose to stand aloof from the controversy. But he adds that the conference is not intended to serve as (I involved. debating floor for the issues He does add that this will be the first time a large number of nations of differing and contrasting ideologies overlooks a meeting will meet together. But there he nations naground for precisely the same three categories of that has been in action for ten years come April mely the United Nations.
He points out that the conference will not be called upon to discuss issues as between the various nations represented. But if that is so, why is not Israel represented?
About the only positive point in the conference, according to Mr. Nehru, will be that it is an ""experiment in co-existence"", But there is a good deal that is inconsequential in using the world ""coexistence."" It is something that has been accepted since the beginning of man who would be extinct aS a species now if he had not learned by instinct, back before the Peking, the Piltdown Or the Neanderthal, that co-existence is as essential to keeping alive as food, water and air. Unless, that is, we accept the Soviet Russian premise that co-existence, like the radio and the airplane, among other things, was first discovered by a Russian.

All of which leaves one somewhat confused as to the purpose and objective of the Afrasian conference.

"The contribution we have in mind to make to the promotion of world peace and cooperation will remain an unrealized dream if we continue to neglect the essentiality of finding effective ways and peaceful means to enable us to settle our differences. In fact it is the solution of these problems amongst us that we can consider as the first step in the direction of peace in its worldwide sense.
To consider social, economic and cultural problems of special interest to Asian and African peoples ; to view the position of Asia and Africa and to think of making contribution to the promotion of the World Peace and cooperation, are questions that can never be answered, and problems that can never be solved, except by being quite frank with one another, a frankness which should express the sincerity of our genuine willingness and desire to assist in the peaceful settlement of World Problems. I say ""World Problems"" because we cannot ignore the fact that whatever happens anywhere in the world is bound to affect us wherever we may be.

There has been much talk recently that the days of colonialism are over; that since certain countries have become independent the position has changed. There is no doubt that many changes have taken place in certain parts of the world, but there are still many millions of people who suffer under the yoke of alien domination in one way or another.
Most of the countries represented here have suffered from alien domination and are well ecquainted with the circumstances which either directly or indirectly have affected all of them.
Devoted as we are to the great cause of ""Liberty and Equality for All"", we should bear in mind that it would be tragic and ridiculous for countries which have attained their own hard-won freedom and have suffered privations and hardships, to think of dominating others or, in their own turn, to deprive others of their liberty.
There has been much talk about co-existence lately.
Our consideration of this idea which has become a
prominent topic in international affairs should be as realistic as possible.
As long as the powers do not believe that the policy of imposing Or defending a certain ideology, political, social or economic, by means of force and coercion should change in favour of a peaceful and trusting way of life between peoples and nations of the world, any attempt for a practical solution of the existing problems will remain a wishful thought.
A practical and peaceful settlement of existing differences depends upon the abolition of all barriers, between peoples and nations, that would hinder their desire for closer relationship and better understanding.
We cannot help reminding ourselves of the fact that in the prevailing atmosphere of colonialism, even countries which in their fight for their political independence succeeded to preserve Or to win back their freedom from alien domination have suffered from lasting economic difficulties. Afghanistan as a land-locked country is an example of such an almost permanent economic privation.
And thus a condition has been imposed that countries which are more or less producers of raw materials are confronted with obstacles in the way of promoting commercial relations and trade between themselves.

It might rightly seem that such studies would require more time than the Conference can spare here and now. but it is clear that if a Commission of Experts is set up to carry on this task, although their findings will not be available during this Conference, their studies would provide a tangible basis for the development of the idea of economic cooperation among the Asian-African countries.
In consideration of the economic problems of the underdeveloped countries, among steps to be taken in this direction, particular attention should be paid to the necessity of closer cooperation among the Asian-African States, members of the United Nations, in the economic field as planned and undertaken by the United Nations Organisation.",address,,"Sardar Mohammad Naim, Afghanistan",,Opening

To them it implied only that the country invited was in general agreement with the purposes of the Conference.

We are of the opinion that the provisional agenda which had been circulated in advance provided coverage of all the points which can possibly be raised. Henceforth we have not attempted to augment it by suggesting further points; our attempt was merely confined to narrowing down its wide generic terms with a view to facilitate the attainment of fruitful discussion and reaching concrete result. The problems of imperialism and foreign domination which cause deep concern to a number of nations in Asia and Africa is for instance one which calls for collective action and sincere co-operation, not because ol ill-feeling towards any particular country, but because

In the sphere of culture we can also create a breathing space for our cultural energy and thereby enrich the human treasures of thought.

The sense of moral and spiritual values in life is ingrained into our nature: it is part of ourselves, it is our

Righteousness or the moral law shall prevail, because Buddhism, Islam and Christianty all teach the same lesson the dignity and worth of man, faith in fundamental human rights, and respect for fundamental freedom for all without distinction aS to creed, colour or race.

My Government is happy that the States in Indo-China have regained their independence and our best wishes go to Laos, Cambodia and the State of Vietnam. We are glad, too, that with the approaching elections, Malaya is well on the way to selfgovernment, which IS to be welcomed as a prelude to independence.
Thailand's love of peace and freedom is well known in the history of international relations and my country has always attached fundamental value to international cooperation.
The five principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in

each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, can be understood, except as regards the last principle of peaceful coexistence. What exactly does this mean ? Does it mean ""live and also let live"", which is the right principle? Does it imply the practice of tolerance as is explicitly stated in Charter of the United Nations? For the Charter says ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours"".
These doubts in my mind must first be cleared up.
In view of this situation as well as of the invasion of Laos by Vietminh forces in 1953 and also in 1954, Thailand has had clearly to face a threat of infiltration and subversion, if not of aggression itself.
Thailand only seeks to protect itself against aggression and subversion and no one without aggressive design need have any fear of my country. The Thai Delegation, I repeat, has come to this Conference with goodwill towards all.",address,,"Prince Wan, Thailand",,Opening
"I am deeply moved by the significance of the fact that such a large number of nations of Asia and Africa are here assembled under one roof. Could it have been possible to effect such a gathering ten years ago ? And had it been possible, how many independent countries would have been among us ?
This in itself is the most vivid proof that the constant struggle of mankind for their rights and liberties is for ever on the move.
Tension and insecurity have clouded the political horizon ever since the end of the Second World War. Ambitions of domination, threats of territorial integrity, interference in the internal affairs of others whether by force or infiltration and in some cases armed aggression itself, have constantly kept us on the alert and forced upon us the necessity of extreme vigilance for the safeguarding of world peace and of our national independence.
About this period, my country, Turkey, also had to face ambitions directed against its independence and integrity. Pressure was exercised on us to make us cede part of our territory and to force upon us conditions which were incompatible with our national sovereignty and independence. This pressure came to us from a neighbouring country with which we had previously concluded a treaty of friendship and non-aggression, a country with which we had entertained friendly relations and to which we had extended precious help by our benevolent attitude during the war.

These are the reasons and conditions which gave birth to the defensive alliance of peace-loving countries named the ""North Atlantic Treaty Organization"".

The same reasons, the same determination to resist aggression and defend Peace, brought about the Balkan Pact, the Turkish-Pakistani Treaty of Friendly Collaboration, the Turkish-Iraqi Pact, the South East Asia Treaty Organization, and other similar agreements.
It was only after it became clear that the peace-loving countries were prepared to defend themselves and to stop aggression that hesitation was seen in the aggressive camp in the prospects of unleasing a ""shooting war""' and the word ""coexistence"" began to be used in their ranks.
Thus freedom, independence and Peace are not blessings that are bestowed on us without effort, but rather they are ideals whose attainment Or safeguarding place a heavy burden of responsibility upon the shoulders of every one of us.
To fail to realise these truths, to take the line of least resistance, and to hope that by shutting one's eyes to danger one may find security, is a course which is perilous not only to the one who follows it but also to the entire community. Such illusions have existed in very recent times. They have all come to disastrous ends.
The instance of the well-meaning but misguided state of Czechoslovakia has already been appropriately cited from this rostrum.

"DISTRIBUTED SPEECH The Asia and Africa of today are nO longer the countries of this Asia and Africa of yesterday. Many region have taken their destiny into their own hands after long years of endeavours. Our Conference itself reflects this profound historical change. has
However, the rule of colonialism in this region not yet come to an end, and new colonialists are attempting to take the place of the old ones. Not a few of the Asian and African peoples are still leading a life of colonial slavery. Not a few of the Asian and African peoples are still subjected to racial discrimination and deprived of human rights.
The courses which we peoples of the Asian and African countries have taken in striving for freedom and independence may vary, but our will to win and preserve our freedom and independence is the same.
However different the specific conditions in each of our most of countries may be, it is equally nesessary for us to eliminate the state of backwardness caused by the rule of colonialism. We need to develop our countries independently with no outside interference and in accordance with the will of the people.

In China, ever since the people became masters of their own country, all their efforts have been aimed at the elimination of backwardness left behind by the prolonged semi-colonial society and the building of their country into an idustrialized one. In the last five years, we have rehabilitated the national economy ruined by long years of war, and have since 1953 started the first five-year plan of economic construction. As a result of these efforts, production in all the main fields, such as iron and steel, cotton cloth, grains, have exceeded the level of any period in the history of China. But these achievements are still very small as compared with our actual needs. Our country IS still very backward as compared with the highly industrialized ones. Like other countries in Asia and Africa, we are in urgent need of a peaceful international environment for the development of our independent and sovereign economy.

People irrespective of race or color should all enjoy the fundamental human rights and not be subjected to any maltreatment and discrimination. However, we cannot help being aware that the peoples of Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and other dependent peoples who have been fighting for independence, have never ceased to be suppressed with violence. Racial discrimination and persecution under racialism in the Union of South Africa and other places have not yet been curbed. The problem of Arab refugees of Palestine still remains to be solved.

The struggle of the Egyptian people for the restoration the Suez Canal Zone, the struggle of their sovereignty over of the Iranian people for the restoration of sovereignty and the demand for the over their petroleum resources, restoration of territorial rights of India over Goa and of
Indonesia over West Irian, have all won sympathy from to liberate many countries in Asia and Africa. China's will her own territory Taiwan has likewise won the support of all righteous people in the Asian-African region. This proves that the peoples of our Asian and African countries understand each other and have sympathy and concern for one another.
Peace can only be safeguarded by mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The encroachment on the sovereignty and territory of any country and the interference in the internal affairs of any country will inevitably endanger peace.

The Geneva Conference was able to create favourable conditions for the establishment of an area of peace. But after the Geneva Conference we witnessed a development in the opposite direction. This is not in the interest of the Indo-Chinese states, nor is it in the interest of peace. We hold that the Geneva agreements on the restoration of peace in Indo-China should be strictly and faithfully carried out. No interference or obstruction from any quarter should be allowed. The question of peaceful unification of Korea should also be solved in accordance with the same principles.
We Asian and African countries need to cooperate in the economic and cultural fields in order to facilitate the elimination of the economic and cultural backwardness caused by the long period of colonial exploitation and oppression. This cooperation should be based on equality and mutual benefit, with no conditions for privilege attached. The trade relations and economic cooperation between us should have for its purpose the promotion of the independent economic development in each country, and not to convert any country into a sole producer of raw materials and a market for consumer needs. Our cultural exchange should have respect for the development of the national culture of each country, and not to ignore the characteristics and special merits of the culture of any country SO that we may learn and benefit from each other.

India, Burma and China have affirmed the five principles of peaceful coexistence as the guiding principles in their mutual relations. These principles have received support from more and more countries. Following these principles China and Indonesia have already achieved good results in their preliminary talks on the question of the nationality of the citizens of one country residing in the other. During the Geneva conference, China also

expressed its readiness to develop friendly relations with the
Indo-Chinese states on the basis of these five principles. There is no reason why the relations between China and Thailand, the Philippines and other neighbouring countries cannot be improved on the basis of these five principles. China is ready to establish normal relations with other Asian and African countries on the basis of the strict adherence to these principles and is willing to promote the normalization of relations between China and Japan. In order to promote mutual understanding and cooperation among us, we propose that the governments, parliaments and peoples' organizations of the Asian and African countries make friendly visits to each other's countries.",address,,"Chou En-lai, China",,Opening
"SUPPLEMENTARY SPEECH
The Chinese Delegation has come here to seek unity and not to quarrel. We Communists do not hide the fact that we believe In communism and that we consider the socialist system a good system. There IS no need at this Conference to publicize one's ideology and the political system of one's country, although differences do exist among us.
The Chinese Delegation has come here to seek common ground, not to create divergence.

As for the tension created, solely by the United States, in the area of Taiwan, we could have submitted for deliberation by the Conference an item such as the proposal made by the Soviet Union for seeking a settlement through an international conference.
Again, we could have submitted for deliberation by the Conference the question of recognizing and restoring the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
Besides, we could have also made criticisms here as regards the unfair treatment of China by the United Nations. But we did not do all this, because otherwise our Conference would be dragged into disputes about all these problems without any solution.
Now first of all I would like to talk about the question of different ideologies and social systems. We have to admit that among our Asian and African countries we do have different ideologies and different social systems. But this does not prevent us from seeking common ground and being united. Many independent countries have appeared since the Second World War. One group of them are countries led by the Communist Parties ; another group of them are countries led by nationalists.
Secondly, I would like to talk about the question as to whether there is freedom of religious belief. Freedom of religious belief is a principle recognized by all modern

nations. We Communists are atheists, but we respect all those who have religious belief. We hope that those with religious belief will also respect those without. China is d country where there is freedom of religious belief. There are in China not only seven million Communists, but also tens of millions of Moslems and Buddhists and millions of Protestants and Catholics. Here in the Chinese Delegation, there is a pious Eamam of the Islamic faith. Such a situation is no obstacle to the internal unity of China. Why should it be impossible in the community of Asian and African countries to unite those with religious belief and those without ?
Thirdly, about the question of the so-called subversive activities.

Chiang Kai-shek is still using some very few overseas Chinese to carry out subversive activities against the countries where they are residing. The people's government of new China, however, is ready to solve the problem of dual nationality of overseas Chinese with the governments of the countries concerned. Some other people say that the autonomous region of Thai people in China is a threat to others. There are in China more than forty million national minorities of scores of natonalities. The Thai people, and the Chuang people who are of the same stock as the Thai people, number almost ten milion. Since they do exist, we must grant them the right of autonomy. Just as there is an autonomous state for Shan people in Burma, every national minority in China has its autonomous region. The national minorities in China exercise their right of autonomy within China, how could that be said as being a threat to our neighbour?
The problem at present is not that we are carrying out subversive activities against the governments of other countries, but that there are people who are establishing bases around China in order to carry out subversive activities against the Chinese Government. For instance, on the border between China and Burma, there are in fact remnant armed elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique who are carrying out destructive activities against both China and Burma.

China has no intention whatsoever to subvert the governments of its neighboring countries. On the contrary, it is China that is suffering from the subversive activities which are openly carried out without any disguise by the United States of America. Those who do not believe in this may come to China or send someone there to see for themselves.
We welcome the delegates of all the participating countries in this Conference to visit China at any time they like. We have no bamboo curtain, but some people are spreading a smokescreen between us.",address,,"Chou En-lai, China",,Opening
"It is because we are fully aware of the special importance of this conference, it is because we sincerely want to serve the cause of peace and freedom, that our Govhere ernment has accepted to come and meet with you in Bandung.
Another reason has also motivated our earnest acceptance i.e., Vietnam is one of the nations in
Southeast Asia, which, unfortunately, had been placed for almost a century under the oppression of foreigners, and only recently, thanks to the numberless efforts and sacrifices of our people, did it regain its independence. Deeply aware of all the sufferings of an oppressed people such as in our case, we are naturally the most ardent supporters of all undertakings which may help small them nations gain quickly their independence, and provide with adequate means to strengthen that independence, in order to live under a regime of true freedom, respecting human personalities and the basic rights of mankind. However, in order to further clarify the position of our Government at this Assembly, we deem it necessary to add that, despite our devotion to the cause of peace and our desire to fasten the ties of friendship with all nations in the world, we strongly protest against all antiinternational undertakings which, under the pretext of serving the cause of Peace, violate the inalienable right of self-determination of a people, a right which has been solemnly recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Declaration of May 2nd, 1954 by the Colombo Powers here present to-day.
We don't need to go far to look for evidences ; for

our country itself has suffered from such an anti-international solution. In the final declaration issued at the close of the Colombo Conference, the Prime Ministers of the participating Powers, here present today, have in fact agreed that the solution to the Indo-China problem required direct negotiations among the parties concerned, viz., France, the three Associated States and the Vietminh, as well as other parties invited by general consent. Yet the Geneva agreements were signed without taking any consideration of the recommendations and protestations strongly made by our Government.
After partition of our country, our people North of the 17th parallel, refusing to stay under a dictatorial regime and wanting to live in a truly free country, have spontaneously emigrated southward to live in peace under the protection of the National Government. Despite obstacles of all kinds created by our opponents (of which we are ready to exhibit evidence any time if necessary), despite the strong attachment of our people to their native villages, until now nearly a million of our countrymen from the North have resolutely left their homes, their properties, the tombs of their ancestors, all they cherish the most in life, to choose and enjoy freedom south of the 17th parallel.
Devoted to the cause of liberty, our government has done everything in its power to assist the refugees from the North to preserve the freedom they have dearly obtained, often at the cost of their very lives. It makes every effort to translate it into a truly happy life under a democratic government.",address,,"Nguyen Van Thoai, State Of Viet-Nam",,Opening
"On the eve of the Conference, various leading American papers speculated that both Nehru and Chou En-lai might use the Conference as a sounding-board as regards Matsu, Quemoy and Taiwan. With variations here and there the editorials presented almost similar views that the United States' Far Eastern policy might be viewed with criticism by the Conference.
The Sunday edition of the ""Washington Post"" stated in its editorial that passionate eloquence against specific evils would undoubtedly be produced. Dr. Ali Sastroamidjojo, the paper said, could not pass up the opportunity to get a few anti-Dutch sentiments off his chest. He was after all the father of the Bandung Conference and hoped
10 earn considerable domestic kudos out of the proceedings. So, the paper continued, the claims to. Irian were due to be pushed into the international limelight again. It would not be surprising if America were included amongst the imperialists and found herself branded as a residuary of imperialism.

On the other hand columnist Chalmers Roberts advocated seriously U.S. understanding of what is happening at Bandung. The Conference would certainly, in Roberts' opinion, result in more pressure from the have-nots of the world for a better share of the world's goods. Hence the long-term effect of Bandung would not be able to be measured as much by what was said or done or thought this week, as by the way in which the Western ""have"" which the nations responded, and above all by the way in U.S. responded. If the U.S. let itself be irritated by what it heard this week from Bandung, and there would be plenty of irritants, Americans would probably be losers in the end. But, the Washington Post columnist continued, if the challenges which Bandung offered to the West were backed up, and efforts were made to meet them, then the Asian-African Conference could turn out to have been a useful affair from the U.S. viewpoint.
The Bandung Conference was an historical landmark for that half of the world which has been asleep for 500 years or more. The Asian nations were on their feet at long last.
Roberts was certain that it was not entirely these peoples' own conduct or will which would shape their future. The Soviet Union was watching to lend a hand, and Red China, barely awake itself, was promising aid. Somebody's proffer of a hand was going to be accepted, the columnist concluded.

Peggy Durdin, writing for the Sunday magazine of the ""New York Times"" from Singapore called for betterU.S. understanding of Asia. She pointed out that viewing Communist emergence in Asia, the U.S. could not, by bombs and military pacts, save Asia from Communism, which was expanding most effectively not through military invasion but through indigenous upheavals and revolution. Not even American economic and technical assistance could do it. No one knew better than the Chinese Communists that man does not live by bread alone. If all or part of Asia was to be saved, Asians themselves would do it. In many Asians' view the function of the West of the U.S.A. was important but secondary. It was to be a good friend and neighbour in every sense of the word.
The ""New York Herald Tribune"" pointed out that resentment of the past might be the common factor for many of these 29 diverse nations that have been subjected to control by Europe or U.S.A. Because of the strong diversity amongst participating nations, the Herald Tribune suggested that the need at Bandung wás to realize that the greatest peril to growing freedom of Asia and Africa was not to be found in nations excluded from the Conference because of race or geography, but in the Conference's own ranks in Red China and its apologists, in those who would use old hatreds to build new slavery, who were SO blinded by the past that they couldn't see the threat of the future.

The ""New York Daily Worker"" pointed out that the Asian-African Conference constituted a declaration of independence from Western imperialism but offered a friendly hand to the American people and mutually beneficial relations, including peaceful co-existence and the recognition of sovereignty and equality of all peoples.
In-an article entiled ""Asian-African Nations enter upon a New Road"", the New York Times Far Eastern correspondent Tillman Durdin wrote on the eve of the Conference that this gathering was regarded by its participants as representing an emphatic assertion of their right of existence and independence, and a gesture to underline these factors to the West. Many delegates were viewing this feeling as the most important aspect of the Conference. It might be possible, they were inclined to believe, to arrive at agreement on certain broad propositions, but disagreement was inevitable on many specific issues. It was recognized here, in Durdin's view, that there was

more diversity than uniformity of interest and viewpoint at
Bandung, despite the fact that the participants had certain characteristics in common.
The anti-Communist powers such as Turkey, Thailand,
Iraq, South Vietnam and the Philippines, were not likely to agree with Communist China and North Vietnam on many issues, Mr. Durdin continued. The five principles of co-existence would certainly be supported by both India and
Communist China. But, because these have been made the theme of Communist propaganda, the antiCommunist powers would certainly find these principles difficult to accept. It was generally considered that Chou

En-lai would be attempting to be as moderate as possible in an effort to get resolutions of a general nature adopted by the Conference. It was believed that Chou had striven to avoid public evidence of differences with Nehru, and by this tactic was trying to swing a maximum amount of Asian-African opinion into association with Peking Bandung last weekend promised very little little achievement, the New York Times correspondent concluded.
The long-term effect of what the Conference did might depend more on propaganda use made of the Bandung decisions, and on informal contacts made, than upon any agreements or disagreements produced.",press,,,America,
"Treaty on the Question of Dual Nationality Between China and Indonesia

It is clear that the Conference is providing delegates and visitors with many opportunities for forming the basis of lasting relationships at both personal and official levels. It is also providing an opportunity for furthering discussions and implementing arrangements which have already been begun between different countries. It is now clear that the friendly atmosphere of the Conference can result in concrete agreements on questions which have been under discussion for some time past.
A Treaty concerning the question of dual nationality was signed on April 22nd between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia.

A short ceremony was held in the Residence of the Governor of West Java, when the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Indonesia, Sunarjo, received Chou En-lai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.

The Vietnamese people give their full support to the Chinese people's struggle to recover their territorial integrity, to the struggle for unity of the people's Democratic Republic of Korea. They energetically urge the solution of such problems as those of West Irian, Goa, Malaya, Kenya and such other issues, upon the basis of respect of territorial integrity and the right to independence and equality among the peoples.

In the history of the Asian and African countries extensive cultural and trade exchanges have proved to be a driving force for the progress of each country, for the general development and progress of all the Asian-African countries.
Colonialism and wars have broken these ancient and precious contacts, created barriers of segregation and racial hate, prevented all economic and cultural intercourse. Clear evidence of this is the embargo enforced in recent years which has caused great harm to the economic development in all the Asian-African countries and throughout the world.
After the Geneva Conference, the struggle of Viet-Nam entered a new stage, aiming at thoroughly implementing the armistice agreements, consolidating peace, achieving unity, independece and democracy all over the country. Under very difficult conditions, the Vietnamese people

have correctly implemented the provision aimed at ending the war and restoring peace.
The 300-day period for the withdrawal of the troops of both sides to their respective regrouping zones is coming to an end. A new period is opening, in which the problem of Viet-Nam's unity by free general elections must be settled. Viet-Nam is a united country, and no one can divide her. The word Unity has its imprint on VietNam's history, geography, economy, culture, language, customs.
The Government of the Democratic Republic of VietNam has declared its readiness to restore normal relations of all kinds between North and South in order to prepare the Consultative Conference, between the authorities in the North and the South next July 1955, as a first step towards the achievement of Viet-Nam's unity, and it has also declared its readiness to enter into contact with the outhorities in the South.
But immediately after the restoration of peace in Indochina, the aggressive imperialists who had been planning the continuance and extension. of the Indochinese war, endeavoured to organise a military bloc directed against the Geneva Agreements, within the so-called ""area of protection"" of which South Viet-Nam, Cambodia and Laos would be involved. They have tried their best to increase their intervention in the internal affairs of the South, to set up new military bases and send new weapons and military personnel to South Viet-Nam.

The suppression of democratic liberties, strangulation of the will for peace and unity of the people in South Viet-Nam, and creation of the present conflicts in the South, thereby troubling order and security and menacing the people's peaceful existence, are all actuated by their hands. One of their most devilish schemes was to induce and comple some sections of the people, especially the Catholics, to go to the South, in order to supply their newly created army units with soldiers and their rubberplantations with labour.

"In less than seven years of Malan-Strijdom rule South Africa is today virtually a police-slave-state. The traditional policy of the country of denial of political rights to non-Whites, economic handicap, restriction on the freedom of movement, and social segregation and discrimination against the non-Whites, has been ruthlessly and shamelessly intensified under the name of apartheid. Today we have political regimentation and control of the non-White population, economic strangulation and expropriation of the property of the non-Whites. This is done in defiance of the resolutions and declarations of the-United Nations Organisation.
This policy is straining race relations in South Africa to a very dangerous point. It is creating an anti-White fceling among the non-Whites, and while things may seem quiet and peaceful at present, the masses of our people are deeply wounded in the soul. They are bitter and sullen One of these days there will be some terrible and shocking anti-White riots and explosions, the like of which has never been seen before In South Africa. Perhaps what we saw at Port Elizabeth and East London at the end of 1952 when innocent whites were killed by Africans in the ""locations"" was a forestaste, In miniature, of the shape of things to come.

No people on earth, no matter how loyal and lawabiding it may be, or no matter how overawed and cowed it may be, can endure for long such a policy of utter ruthlessness and shameless and flagrant injustices.
While the Whites in South Africa possess full citizenship rights and enjoy the fat, riches and comports which that country can provide, the non-Whites are without any rights.
They are denied the right to take part in the choosing of the government which rules them and they have no say in the affairs and administration of their country. They are taxed without representation; denied freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and freedom of organisation. They are economically oppressed and exploited, they may not trade, live, buy or own land where they like. Under the Group Areas Act they are to lose their properties, businesses, institutions and places of worship. The civil service and skilled occupations in industry, trades and commerce are debarred to them. They are treated in a stepmotherly fashion in the provision of education and social services, and they are socially discriminated against and daily insulted and humiliated.
In addition to all this the Africans who form 67.5% of the total population have been allotted 13% of the land and the Whites who comprise only 20.9% of the

population have allotted to themselves 87 % of the country's best land: rich in minerals, fertile and wellwatered. They are paid miserable wages, starved of education, prohibited from entering urban areas, and subjected to humiliating pass, permit and liquor laws which were responsible for the conviction and sentence. of 739,400 Africans in 1952.
Should there be any anti-White explosions in South Africa the Government will be responsible. But though the Government of the Union of South Africa will be responsible for any racial disaster that might occur there in the future, it would be criminal on our part on the part. of all democratic-minded people of South. Africa and, to some extent, also on the part of the civilised and freedom-loving peoples of the world were we to allow the situation in South Africa to get from bad to worse. It is absolutely imperative, therefore, that all men of goodwill should do everything in their power to try to ease the race tension in South Africa. We cannot allow the impression to get fixed in the minds of the nonWhites that all White peoples are against them.
What is happening in South Africa is not the concern of the people of South Africa alone but also the concern of the peoples of the rest of the world. The sufferings of the non-White people there are a challenge to all civilised peoples of the world. All who are free and who love freedom cannot look on silently and passively while a gross injustice in being done tO a people just because of its race and colour.

Something must be done about the unhealthy human relationship and illtreatment of non-White peoples in South Africa before it is too late.
We have, therefore, come to this historic and worldinspiring conference of the free and non-racial nations of Asia and Africa with this main object : we have come to request thein to use their good offices internationally to persuade the other civilised and freedom-loving nations of the world to prevail upon the Government of the Union of South Africa to abandon its unjust and disastrous policy of apartheid and racial discrimination. We are convinced and confident that the Government of South Africa could be forced to reconsider its reactionary and inhuman policy if all the nations which do not approve of policies and practices of racial oppression and discrimination, particularly the Governments of the United States of America and Great Britain, would boldly take a firm stand against such practices. The United States of America and Great Britain owe it to humanity to see to it that justice and fairness are accorded all men in all countries under the sphere of their influence.

"Australia was not formally invited by the Five sponsoring Powers to the Asian-African Conference. The reason given is that Australia was not considered to be in the region covered by the Conference.
It is our view that Australia does in fact lie in the Asian area; for if not in that area, to what region does she in fact belong ?
Australia's place in the Asian area was recognised for the purpose of the two conferences which took place in Delhi in 1949 and in Baguio in 1950.
It is our view that Australia should have been invited to this Conference and should have accepted; and should on all future occasions be invited and attend.
Australian interest in and sense community with Asia is growing; it is unfortunate that exclusion from the Conference may check this sentiment and reinforce outworn attitudes to Asian problems.
Public sentiment for closer relations with Asia has been expressed both in the platforms of political parties

such as the Australian Labour Party and by non-party of the World organizations such as the Australian Section
Council of Churches.
The Government of Australia has frequently stated its intention of increasing its representation in Asia and multiplying its contacts with the governments of independent Asia.

"The speeches of the chief delegates to the Bandung Conference have shown one common ground; the question of colonialism and word peace.
Almost all of the nations attending the AA conference have had common experiences. It is therefore imperative that the Asian and African nations, whatever system of government and economy they have, must seek understanding of each other. Out of this understanding must be built a greater appeciation and must be concluded by a collective action to reach the common desire of all Asian and African nations in particular and of mankind in general. President Sukarno mentioned the fact that colonialism is not yet dead. Many shapes of colonialism have to be wiped out to guarantee a free and independent action of every individual nation, small or big to work for the benefit of its own people. It is therefore a question of great importance that very nation-attendant of the AA Conference should analyse first of all his own position in the rank and file of nations of the world before going to attack the principles and the political creeds of any individual nations, whether in Asia, Africa or the West.
If we start attacking communism in all its forms, we could also launch attacks on colonialism and imperialism.

If a nation, naive and unexperienced steps forwards with the question: does lenin-marxism concord with the coexistence principles, or is it not aggression what the communists have done in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and other countries in Eastern Europe or in China in order to secure their power ? then the question could be raised what the Americans are doing in European countries with their mighty air, sea and landforces, or why Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria are still suffering under the yoke of French imperialism. We do not yet mention West Irian, which is a threat to Indonesian independence as much as Taiwan iSa threat to China's independence or Cyprus and Suez Canal to Greece and Egypt.
To possess part of a nation's territory or the territory as a whole is aggression, but a frozen one. So to say if the West attacks the East or vice versa, then it must be remembered that both of them are sitting in the same boat.
The A-A Conference is not meant to be another battlefield of these two conflicting ideologies and Weltanschauung. It is our common desire to contribute to world peace.
It is for us Asian and African countries that we must cooperate in all fields, particularly in the economic field, as all of us are needy nations. All this can be done

when there is no world tension which upsets all efforts of reconstruction for the benefit of the countries and peoples concerned.
Indonesia, which has had a turbulent past can be a sample to the world that she is fighting now to forget the past and to head for the future.
Tolerance is the biggest asset of Indonesia. Indonesians fought colonialism and imperialism without mercy, but she is now trying to forget this unhappy memories. And the same Indonesia fought communism at the same time, so that our country has had the experience of figthing colonialism and communism. However, tolerance should replace hatred, because only through tolerance and understanding a nation can be built and peace restored.
All we want 1S peace. Let it be the only aim of this conference. Because peace in the real sense implies the possibilities of all the nations to work for their future. The voices of the representatives of three-fifths of the world population cannot be ignored, if all of them are genuine fighters for the preservation of peace.

"Asians, who have been under the domination of Western countries, are naturally in full agreement with the aims of the Asian-African Conference which is now in progress in Bandung.

For centuries the peoples of Asia and Africa were not able to determine their own destinies and had to take orders from foreign peoples who dominated them. Meeting in Bandung in a united front, their representatives are now able to tell the world that we, as God's creatures, are of the same value and importance as Western peoples and have to be accorded equal treatment as human beings.
The Western nations are superior as regard the making of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and other weapons of destruction, but on the other hand the Eastern nations may boast of their religions. Clearly then they are superior in spiritual development.
While arms superiority has always been boasted of at SEATO, NATO and other similar conferences, cooperation and peace are the primary purpose of the Asian
African Conference.
We are now witnessing the clash between armed might and the spirit of peace. History has shown that authority that is backed up by force is not lasting. We are therefore convinced that in the end the spirit of peace will triumph.

Most states are relatively new creations and even most of the ancient sovereign oriental nations share their yearning for more clearly asserted status in world affairs. Equality in such institutions as United Nations is insufficient. Europe has its own institutions such as the Strasbourg Assembly; Asia has the right to follow suit. The mere fact of the holding of the Bandung Conference thus gives great satisfaction to countless people in the East. And nobody in the West would grudge that.

Nevertheless the conference must not be like a flower show; is ought to create and not merely demonstrate. Certainly the sponsors have called for a political discussion but they have never seemed agreed or clear about the aims of this discussion. Never perhaps have the representatives of so many governments assembled with sO little idea of what they are going to do. Unlike Strasbourg, the delegates are not gathered to experiment in political and economic unity nor under the shadow of fear and common peril. The European nations are bonded by communist pressure while Asians have billed the Chinese People's Republic the star performer at Bandung. What concrete result can be expected by the participating powers ? The sad fact is plain that most of the delegations are coming with expectations so different from each other as to be virtually contradictory.
The Indonesians, who initiated the whole project are perhaps the most likely to achieve their purpose, which was primarily to gain prestige and divert attention from their domestic rift and failures by playing host to a glittering assembly. However even this is endangered if internal disorders occur as at the Bogota Pan-American Conference. For the rest so many different harps are being brought. But few can expect general applause. There is likely to be little support for Arabs inveighing against Israel or Thailand fearing Vietminh infiltration.

The Conference, lacking positive purpose, is likely to fall back on negative ones, to descend to the lowest common denominator and stay there, and where Asians are gathered the denominator is anti-werternism, still usually labelled anti-colonialism in spite of the colonial retreat in the last decade. It is ironic that the only colonial Empire in Asia is Russia's, while anti-colonialism is used as stick to beat America's traditionally anti-colonial policy. Though anti-colonialism is absurdly outmoded, many use it as a slogan to propitiate the people and incidentally to loosen the western purse strings if possible. It may

be assumed that strictures will be voiced on the Dutch in Irian, the French in North Africa, the Portugese in Goa, and the British in Malaya.
All this is convenient for the Communists who staged a warm-up in Delhi in the previous week where Peking mouthpiece Kuo, oblivious of African problems, chiefly aimed at branding American Formosa policy as colonial by associating it with remnants of colonialism in Asia. The Communists at Bandung will probably show their usual skill in concealing their real aims. To carry other countries they will probably induce only oblique denuncations of America in the final communique. If they cannot convert they can at least divide, exploiting differences between states with and without defencive links with the West and painting a picture of pro-Western governments against the rest, and pose as friends and sympathizers of the unattached.
Yet the more clear-sighted non-Communistis will see the real division between China and vassal states on the one hand, and the rest of Asia on the other. Since 1950 the rest of Asia has had no real contact with the Chinese

censored and foreign envoys People's Republic, as news iS work hard to segregated. The Chinese delegation must disguise this cruel fact, which is backed up with an unrivalled propaganda machine and with unrivalled military power in the background.
Will the non-communists let themselves become red puppets, or look behind the smiles of Chou and Dong, noting the Chinese People's Republic's admission of a collectivbottleneck in industrialization and resistance to ization, and the fact that the Chinese People's Republic's own revolution, like Russia's, has begun to devour its children such as Kao Kang.
If the Communists put on too much pressure at Bandung they may come away as disappointed as many other delegations will; and some useful lessons in realism will then be taken to heart. But one would be rash to count on any definable gain from the conference that would offset the danger of a welter of inchoate, an in part harmful, rhetoric. This first council of Asia has an inauspicious setting.

"FOREIGN MINISTER SUNARIO
Your Excellency, the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China.
May I first, in the name of my Government of the Republic of Indonesia, express happiness at the fact that agreement has been reached between our Government and Your Excellency's Government as regards a settlement of the question of dual nationality between our two States The reaching of agreement 1S clear from the signing of the text of the Treaty just now.
The signing of this Treaty is an event of the greatest importance not only for our State and People but also for the State and People of Your Excellency.

For is it not true that this Treaty opens up the possibility of putting an end to a situation which has gone on for years and years, but which we now regard as no longer fitting ?
Our Government iS happy too because this signing has come at the very time of the holding of the AsianAfrican Conference, which is also an event of historic importance in the relations between the States of Asia and Africa.
Everything can go smoothly when an atmosphere of neighbourliness prevails, which it is to be hoped will always prevail between the State of the Republic of Indonesia and the State of the People's Republic of China.
Thank you.",general,dual nationality,"Sunario, Indonesia",,

Your Excellency our respected Minister for Foreign
Affairs Dr. Sunario, Gentlemen:
It is a great privilege for me to sign today on behalf of the People's Republic of China ""The Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia concerning the Question of Dual Nationality"". Allow me to extend on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China our sincere congratulations to the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and to Your Excellency Foreign Minister Sunario.
The Republic of Indonesia and our country have always maintained good neighbourly relations. Our two countries have always respected and have been friendly 10 each other. The question of dual nationality is a question left to us by the past. Now it is reasonably settled through friendly negotiations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect.

We know that some other countries are likewise concerned about this question. It is of great significance that this question is solved during the time of the AsianAfrican Conference. This is another good example of solving difficult questions between us Asian and African countries in a spirit of friendly negotiation.
I guarantee that the Government of the People's Republic of China will firmly carry out the Treaty signed today. I hope that persons of Chinese origin with dual nationality as a result of past history will, after making their choice of nationality in accordance with their own will, strictly abide by the letter and spirit of this Treaty and increase their sense of responsibility towards the country the nationality of which they have chosen. I hope that persons who choose either the nationality of the People's Republic of China or the nationality of the Republic of Indonesia will join their efforts in promoting friendly and neighbourly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia. congratulate the ever strengthening of the friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the

"The Bandung Conference is a historic step towards the final burying of colonialism in the present world. All dependent peoples are following with relief and satisfaction the proceedings of this Conference. In no less degree the Cypriot people participate in these feelings Although the question of Cyprus was not directly considered in the Conference yet the condemnation by it of colonialism in general necessarily includes Cyprus.
Colonialism in its flight from Asia and Africa should not find refuge in Cyprus.
Cyprus, an island in the easternmost part of the Mediterranean, has a population of 520,000, of which 80.2 percent are Greek, 17.9 are Turks and 1.9 various other smaller minorities.

Since 1878 the island is under British administration The Greek people of Cyprus always aspired to their national liberty and for decades now have been repeatedly putting forward with insistence before the British Government their claim to self-determination, but with a negative result.
Cyprus, therefore, is still a British colony. At a time when colonialism has by the progress of humanity been completely condemned and is rapidly dying out everywhere, that it should continue to flourish in an island with a history of civilization extending over 3000 years, is wholly unjustified; its termination calls for the support of all freedom-loving peoples.
The matter was brought up before the United Nations at its last session by Greece as the sponsoring member state at the request of the people of Cyprus.
The claim was inserted in the agenda. under the heading ""The application of the principle of equal rights and self-determination to the population of Cyprus"" No resolution, however, was taken by the General Assembly owing to the reactionary influence of the powers of the colonial block, and the matter was postponed for the ""time being"",
The negative attitude, however, of the Administering State towards the self-determination of Cyprus continues

unaltered, the British Government still treating the matter as one of its own domestic concern, although the discussion in the United Nations proved it to be otherwise.
The mass demonstrations by the people for the self-determination of Cyprus in December last were met by recourse to force and the firing by military units at unarmed demonstrators, while arrests and imprisonments followed; the position is unfortunately becoming very anomalous and fraught with danger.
The people of Cyprus wholeheartedly support all the declared objectives of the Bandung Conference, one of the most important of which is the self-determination of peoples.
We expect that our voice will not go unheeded in the hall of the Bandung Conference. The cause of the people of Cyprus is particularly a moral and just one ; we consequently trust that it will receive the full and sincere support of this significant Conference, which, as stated by its President, sets morality high in its policy, and which may well prove to be a landmark in the progress of mankind.",press,,Archbishop Makarios,,
"Many of the delegates to this Conference have passed through Singapore on their way to Bandung. You have seen the City and you may have met many of the real people born and bred in Singapore of many races and creeds, a good number educated In the most famous universities of the world, just as many of you were. In your countries you have shown in no uncertain way your capacity to manage your own affairs. We, however, are told that we are not. ready yet for complete self-government! On your way home, friends, brothers, and sisters, have a closer look at us and see for yourselves whether there is any logic in that charge of immaturity.
In your busy moments at Bandung we appeal to you to give a few thoughts to Singapore. Some of you have passed through your days of colonial tribulation. Give us

your hands on our road to independence. We are here now to learn from our neighbours some of the answers to our problems.
The delegates of the Singapore Labour Front will take back with them that wonderful spirit of independence which we see all around us at the Bandung Conference.

We have not been invited to this Conference nevertheless permit us to join you in this historic march of the Asian and African peoples. May we hope that in the near future Singapore may be the venue of one of your meetings ?",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"The ""Patriot"" of Medan in North Sumatra, writing as the Conference was beginning to get under way, argued that the Bandung Conference is living proof that peaceful co-existence of peoples of different political systems and ideologies is indeed possible. The holding of the Conference, it added, iS also proof of the fact that the principle of equal rights is being applied.
The paper expressed hope that the problem of normalising economic relations will be solved satisfactorily by the Conference, because there is no reason whatsoever to reject trade extension if it benefits all parties involved. The ""Pewarta Surabaja"" of East Java commented that ""the eyes of the world have now been opened to the fact that in Indonesia, too, there are leaders of big calibre, whose role in world affairs cannot be ignored"".
The paper felt that although Asian and African countries do not possess atomic bombs and other nuclear weapons, they can, for one thing, stop the flow of raw materials for war purposes. It concluded by asking that in their fight for world supremacy the Soviet Union and America should leave Asia and Africa alone.
The ""Sin Po"", a Chinese language paper published in Djakarta, had this to say :

""As is universally known, the Asian-African Conference is attended by twenty-nine countries representing more than half of the world's population. If the Conference succeeds the peoples in these parts of the world will henceforward unite and cooperate and live together in peace. In that case, the age of imperialist domination and enslavement of coloured races in Asia and Africa will forever become a thing of the past and these peoples will be able to decide their own destinies.
""The convening of the Conference is therefore unprecedented in the history of Asia and Africa as well as that of the world. The success of the Conference will open a new road in the development of the Asian and African nations and offer a valuable contribution to the promotion of peace in Asia and Africa and the world as well. The importance of the Conference is clearly undeniable.""

The ""Harian Rakjat"" of Bandung said that the speeches made by President Sukarno and Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo ""have blown a refreshing wind into a world sick of the ruins caused by bombardments during the last war and sick of piles of gunpowder ready to be exploded by people devoid of all human feelings"".
The desires of the Indonesian people are also the desires of all Asian and African nations, the paper continued, and in order to realize these desires cooperation must not cease after the conclusion of the Conference.
The paper suggested that cooperation be continued in the form of permanent or semi-permanent political, economic and cultural commissions with secretariat of a permanent or semi-permanent character, etc. In short, it concluded, the cooperation needs a definite form.
The ""Merdeka"" of Djakarta said that the speeches of President Sukarno and Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo are complementary. If the President's speech contained-an analysis of colonialism, the speech-of the Prime Minister contained a formulation of peace in its modern sense.

The Prime Minister's speech has given clear lines as to the task of the Bandung Conference in formulating a basis for cooperation It is of profound significance and can serve as a guiding principle that only with unity among Asian and African nations can efforts be made towards rapid progress in the political, economic, social and cultural fields. It also serves as an indication for the Western nations that in Bandung, too, constructive efforts can be made towards lasting peace, which can guarantee the present and future generations.",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"*The Manchester Guardian"" referred to the Conference as a novelty in international meetings. Indonesia the paper said, was to gain prestige to cover its internal situation; Japan to gain trade in South-East Asia: Ceylon to propose U.N. Charter reform and Peking to seek a golden opportunity. Over the last few weeks, according to the Manchester Guardian, Peking has relaxed its warlike propaganda about Formosa, because it was

likely that she wanted to arrive at the Conference appearing to offer the blessing of peace, Obviously the aim of Peking, the paper continued, would be to convince the Asian countries that the threat of war came from the
West.
The instrument with which it worked would be the famous five principles of co-existence, which China was using in the Conference as Russia used peace. One of those who had already subscribed to the principles was Mr. Nehru, who certainly did not accept the principles in a Communist or Peking sense. The interest at Bandung would be to see whether Mr. Nehru by taking the Chinese at their peaceful words could steer them willy nilly into peaceful courses. Could he and Asia accept Chinese gifts without bringing on themselves the same fate that befell Troy when it did not look a gift horse in the mouth. The drama at the Conference and the play of political forces would be more complex, according to this British daily, because the Chinese could already count on Mr. Nehru being half in agreement with their interpretation of the present political scene, even though his long term aims and theirs were wide apart.

Nehru, the paper went on, had always disliked intensely the idea of America establishing military and naval bases on Asian soil. He condemned Seato because it might bring, American military power into operation in SouthEast-Asia; earlier he condemned the San Francisco treaty because it enabled America to organize Japan as a base. In the opinion of the Manchester Guardian, Nehru might of course decide at Bandung that he could best employ himself as a mediator, but alternatively he might try to enlist the Conference in protest against America's alleged attempts to settle the affairs of free Asia over free Asia's head. The Manchester Guardian then said that for the Western countries the capital fact about the Conference was that Communist China was being brought into parley by Asian leaders who were men of goodwill, non-Communists and not easy dupes even if they inclined towards neutralism.
Commenting on the speech of President Sukarno, the Manchester Guardian published the following cable from its correspondent in Bandung :
""It was an impressive speech, addressed to an impressive audience in the theatre of a former Dutch club. On the opening of the Conference,"" the paper's correspondent said ""there is an atmosphere of gaiety and enthusiasm which is strangely reminiscent of the earlier and most hopeful assemblies of the League of Nations. In a sense the Asian and possibly the Afro-Asian unity is certainly becoming an important political factor.

""'The prospects of the Conference were improved by the decision that there should be no resolutions. This diminishes the chances of precise decisions but also di-

minishes the danger of a split between the Communists and the anti-Communists
The Manchester Guardian referred to the speech of Chou En-lai as a straw in the wind. He could have beaten the-drum about colonialism and American misdeeds, it went on. Instead he sought to win friends and influence people. Although the speech contained references to colonial oppression, American subversion on Formosa and China's right to the United Nations' seat, the speech was notably moderate in tone.
China said that she was not imposing any ideology and that she accepted religious and political differences among the Asian nations. More practically she offered to discuss the question of the overseas Chinese upon whom Peking were previously ambiguous, Doubtless the speech is tactics, but one reason for the tactics must have been Chou's sensing of the feeling of the Bandung meeting, Many delegates are not ready to cheer anti-colonial denunciation and leave it at that. The question is whether China's tactical regard for Asian feeling can lead here to its moderating its behaviour on Formosa and the off-shore islands.

""The Glasgow Herald"" of 20th April wrote that the Conference could not be dismissed as a Communist plot, though the Communists might plan to harness Asian forces for their own ends. The invitation list for the Conference represented a compromise reached by the sponsoring nations, with various countries invited to counter-balance the presence of China. The diversity of the participants had made it impossible to construct an agenda, but the underlying thought of the meeting was that the participants had to have a greater voice in the world. Many delegates would probably agree with Nehru that the United Nations. is still too American-European. The desire for such a conference stemmed probably from the need to fill the vacuum left by the colonialist retreat. The fact that Indonesia was the initiator was significant, as she was bitterly conscious of her ex-colonial status.
Mohammed Ali and Kotelawala had few illusions about Communism, the paper went on to say. Although Nehru was a prophet of co-existence he was less patient to the Communists in India. U Nu was realistic about China's territorial ambitions in South-East Asia. Thus. while China would be able at Bandung to obstruct useful discussion, she would not be able to perform any diplomatic coup.
For hints as to whether Asia would advance to democracy one should keep one's eyes not on Bandung but on Washington, where a new economic aid programme would be published next week. The battle for the soul of Asia would be won or lost not at conference tables but in fields and factories.

The Birmingham Post detailed the purposes of the Conference, and commented that It wan unique and Inte portant From the point of view of genuine anti-coloniallam, said the paper, cooperation between the two COn tinents IN logical enough, and very proper thing if only it were not bedevilled by that new and more Insidious Imperialism of communism.
The tact that the Chinese delegation in led by Chou En lal. indicates a change of standpoint, the paper comments. Until recently, China would not rub shoul ders with ""bourgeois"" states like India, Jordan, Burma Or Indonesia. In the case ol Indonesia the paper belleven that the reason why the communists have changed their attitude lies in the fact that Indonesia is a free Asian power where the communists are strong.
After some conjecture, the paper says that the COnte munists will try to exploit Bandung AN they did the Geneva Conference, to which the Bandung Conference owes much of its inspiration.
The Daily Worker (London) on April 10 said that the former colonies, colonies and semi-colonies were seeking a common ground because the policies of their colonisers had been to divide and rule them; However, it was not one colonial nation nor the white man in general which was realised to be the enemy, but ""imperialism bound with the present stage of monopoly capitalism"",

The Conference would be unlikely to formulate an immediate programme ol action, said the Daily Worker. But if it lays down the principles and establishes that Asia and Africa must combine against the common enemy, then that is an excellent beginning, the paper concluded.",press,,,Europe,
"Is this only vanity? asks Max Lerner in the .New York Post"". It would be a mistake to conclude that the whole Bandung Conference is only a preening before the mirror ol history by men who like the center of the stage. involved. there aretougher and more stubborn purposes To get at these purposes one must remember that odd
Bandung is neither simple nor monolithic. The thirty Asian and African delegations fall roughly into four groups. One may be called the Nehru-U Nu bloc second the Nasser-Sukarno bloe of Moslem countries : third the Philippines-Thailandor pro-Western bloc : fourth the Chou En-lai or Communist bloc. Each has its satellites. Lerner continues : The him of the Nasser-Sukarno Moslem bloc is not nearly as high-minded. Sukarno wanted the Bandung Conference so that he might gather a cordon of Moslem countries to bolster his Indonesian

regime, The Arab League in turn is coming to Bandung determined to fight out the power struggle between LEypt and Iraq. They will all talk about freedom and pence but the only thing that unites them is hatred of Israel. For that reason the anti Jewish theme is bound to crop Up) at Bandung, however much Nehru and U Nu-may neck (o keep it quiet.
In conclusion, and by way of criticism ol Dulles' policy, the ""Post"" reports : The themes of anti-colonial
Im, colour discrimination and antiwar are the themes that every Communist party in Asia and Africa has been able to appropriate largely because our American policy makers have been NO busy talking military positions and drawing a military line that they have left the juicy slogans for the Communists. All that Chou En lat will have to do will he to exert his charm. sound reasonable, utter bromides, sell the ""Five Principles"" and collect some Int propaganda dividends,
Two days later (19 April) the same paper contains another article from Max Lerner, He says
Historical eventa ARe sometimes like sleeper movies You don't know how historie they are until they hit the screen and paying customers troop in. It is probably as grent 41 surprise to the sponsors notably Nehru and U Nu 41 to everyone else that Bandung has caught the world's imagination.

A story get is that after the Djakarta conference A1 the end of December, neither. Nehru nor U Nu took plans for Bandung very seriously, But All Sastroamidjojo, Indonesian Prime Minister, who hankered for his fellow Moslems of the Arab League to keep him company, scht out invitations. The response WAIN Immediate and all sponsors found to their surprise that they were marking the end and beginning of an era. ""We are marching in step with history"" said Nehru as he left New Delhi for
Bandung, As for the U.S.A., the article continues, the State Department was at first inclined to ask our working allies to boycott Bandung, but in the end sanity prevailed. We arenow playing it straight-faced on the theory that Bandung will have more than one voice, and that the voice for the Western world will also get a hearing, AN a formal policy this is # correct one for US to take. Bandung has also given proof of its impact by forcing President Eisenhower to speed up the announcement of a proposed billion dollar aid program for Asia. The message in in time for the Bandung meeting in order to strengthen the hand of Carlos Romulo and other delegates who are lighting to help it from becoming il Communist weapon,
The Chinese have taken along a large trade and economic delegation which will spend its time in court

ship, says Max Lerner, but it would have been better if we had doubled our Asian aid before Bandung ever met. It would also be more reassuring to Asians if they did not suspect that the President's figures may be seriously whittled down before they pass the scrutiny of Congress and of Secretary Humphrey.
Let no one try to laugh Bandung off. warns Lerner, who then says: We have allowed ourselves to drift into a position where Asians feel we are resisting not encouraging, their claims to a position in world councils. Bandung recognises these claims which is why it has become an outlet for resentment and pride. wish we had the imagination to forget our. fears about Bandung and go all-out in welcoming it. If Dulles' dead hand did not lie on American foreign policy, and if we had a bold president in White House, would it be too much to hope that he might send a straightforward greeting to Bandung ? The President has sent the same old platitudes about ""peaceful aspirations"" and ""renunciations"", but he could have sent another kind of message : a message saying : ""We differ on some things and I may not like the resolutions with which you will end up. implore you not to be misled by the bland promises of several of your delegations which would act like wolves ifthey had you in their power. Nevertheless it is a great day for the world when a resurgent Asia and Africa rise from the lowly positions in which they have crouched for centuries, and assert themselves as part of the world, caught in its doom, heirs to its hopes. We wish you well. and as President of the American people, I hail you"".

Is it just a dream of mine, asks Max Lerner this notion that America can afford the great and generous gesture in place of niggling resistance plus the language of the dollar? Perhaps it is, but I trust the time is not distant when the dream can become a reality.
""The New York Herald Tribune"" comments: The communists did their utmost to create an atmosphere favourable to their cause in advance of the Bandung meeting. They set up a fraudulent Asian African Conference in New Delhi, composed of Reds and fellowtravellers, whose party line resolutions might be used to sow confusion concerning the decisions of the Bandung group. The destruction of a plane carrying Chinese was ascribed by Chou En-lai to ""secret agent organisations of the US and Chiang Kai Shek"".
It is to be expected, the ""'Herald Tribune"" continues, that Red China and the apologists will attempt to bring the Conference around to the kind of denunciations of the West which are the stock in trade of Red propaganda. But the nations at Bandung which recognise the communist peril have seized the initiative. They have demonstrated

chorus to Chou En-lai's solo. They are willing and eager that they have not come to Indonesia merely to sing but they decline to acknowledge to work for peace as a which is now building up a military threat in Formosa peace-loving regime the Communist government strait.
In an editorial the Christian Science Monitor said an Asian conference that Indian Premier Nehru's calling of of eleven nations at New Delhi to work out plans for using
Western economic aid highlighted recent hopeful developments in this field.
The Nehru move comes in time to help keep Asian perspectives realistic. It will remind Asians that they can get help from the West on terms consistent with their own self-respect and freedom. This should help to offset impressions which Communists may wish to create, the paper claimed, at another Asian Conference now getting under way at Bandung that Asian peoples can best achieve their hopes by keeping clear of Western ties, even at the risk of being dominated by the Asian branch of international communism.
Western leadership would do well to note that the Bandung Conference is being organised around political and philosohical concepts as Asians' share to the world. If economic aid to Asia is to make its maximum contribution to an understanding of the free world it must avoid emphasising material aims to the exclusion of other values.

This is one reason why some of America's allies with long experience in the Far East have hoped that new aid to Asia can be launched without too much fanfare. The same paper on April 19 said that it may be asked what one might reasonably expect by way of results from the Bandung Conference. The nature of the agenda adopted did not indicate that any very concrete conclusions were expected, the paper added. In general, Americans and Europeans could afford to applaud any move making for better communications in the world, and could trust that intelligence, moderation and liberality would find spokesmen in any world group which had freely assembled. The New York Times entitled an editorial ""Turnabout at Bandung"". saying that the Conference had begun with a dramatic turnabout which dispels any notion that Asia-and Africa speak with one voice, or that any one leader dare presume to speak for all Asian and African countries. Speakers from the anti-communist countries, the paper said, had drawn up a powerful indictment against the
Communist powers and had marshalled facts which the West had long since known, but which are still too little recognised in the two under-developed continents.
As the basis for their indictment. the editorial said further, the speakers in question pointed out that the

Western powers had been gradually abandoning imperialism, and since the last war had freed no less than
600 commillion people. During this same period the munists on nations, the population of which the other hand had enslaved no less than 6 approached 700 million.
This editorial concluded with the comment that, in view of the applause which greeted the anti-communist speakers, Chou's chances of success are indeed slim.",press,,,America,
"Writing in Pravda on April 16, Pastukhov stated ""The American imperialists, caught unawares by the decisions of the Bogor Conference, opened up an unbridJed campaign against the calling of the Conference. Junior partners of the U.S.A. in such aggressive military blocs as SEATO, submissively joined in. However, the U.S.A.'s attempts to frustrate the Bandung Conference suffered complete failure.
""The Soviet people, together with all progressive mankind look upon the Conference of the Asian and African countries as an important political event in the life of these countries: it facilitates an easing of tension in international relations and the strengthening of universal peace.

""Guided by the feelings of friendship and sympathy for the peoples of Asia and Africa who are courageously struggling for their freedom and independence, the Soviet people wish success to the Bandung Conference.""",press,,,Europe,
"The ""Sydney Morning Herald"" of 16th April argued that the Conference had its origin purely and simply in the Indonesian governing party's desire to win prestige in a general election. What was remarkable was that the remaining four Colombo powers were unwilling to oppose the suggestion, and that 19 other states had accepted the

invitation to attend. That is why the Western powers could not afford to treat the A.A confab lightly.
The Conference, the daily went on to say, was an opportunity seized by a very considerable number of nonwhite nations to assert their place in the world, Whatever forms of words might be used, this was a racial meeting, where the qualification for admission was colour. Fundamentally the delegates were coming to prove to the world that the voice of the white man was not the only one which should command attention. It was an answer to the attitude, that the West still adopts, that coloured races have a subordinate status in world affairs.
On the strictly practical level a conference of this kind was most unlikely to achieve anything at all, the Sydney Morning Herald concluded. It was a demonstation that racial solidarity was stronger than political and economic differences, and that the West had failed to convince the East of its good intentions.

Writing in The Sidney ""Daily Telegraph"", Emery Bares stated that as a sign of the times, and of the new stirrings throughout Asia and Africa, the conference could prove an historic landmark, a register as well as portent of changing values and relations. It might be symbolic of the Closing phases of one era and the beginnings of another. The future of Australia would • be greatly influenced by what came out of Bandung, With so many opportunities for consultation, the federal government of Australia acted properly in directing its ambassador in Indonesia to attend. Apparently, Dr. Bars concluded, much would depend on Mr. Nehru's success or failure as a bridge builder between dissonant elements.
Douglas Wilkie, writing in the ""Melbourne Sun"" of 19th April described the Conference as one of the milestones in the march of mankind. In contemporary Australian eyes the conference was a ""hotchpotch"" assembly. In retrospect it would be memorable as the first conference of its kind. However vague or ""unrealistic"" its resolutions, they served notice to the world that non-white peoples refused any longer to accept Western solutions of world problems.",press,,,Australia,
"FINAL COMMUNIQUE
OF THE
ASIAN-AFRICAN CONFERENCE Held at Bandung from 18th to 24th April, 1955

The Asian-African Conference, convened upon the invitation of the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India. Indonesia and Pakistan met in Bandung from the 18th to the 24th April, 1955. In addition to the sponsoring countries the following 24 countries participated in the
Conference:

1. Afghanistan 2. Cambodia 3. People's Republic of China 4. Egypt 5. Ethiopia 6. Gold Coast 7. Iran 8. Iraq 9. Japan 10. Jordan 11. Laos 12. Lebanon

13. Liberia 14, Libya 15. Nepal 16. Philippines 17. Saudi Arabia 18. Sudan 19. Syria 20. Thailand 21. Turkey 22. Democratic Republic of Vietnam 23, State of Vietnam 24. Yemen

The Asian-African Conference considered problems of common interest and concern to countries of Asia and Africa and discussed ways and means by which their people could achieve fuller economic, cultural and political cooperation.
A. ECONOMIC COOPERATION. l. The Asian-African Conference recognised the urgency of promoting economic development in the AsianAfrican region. There was general desire for economic cooperatian among the participating countries on the basis of mutual interest and respect for national sovereignty. The proposals with regard to economic cooperation within the participating countries do not preclude either the desirability or the need for cooperation with countries outside the region, including the investment of foreign capital. It was further recognised that the assistance being received by certain participating countries from outside the region, through international or under bilateral arrange-

ments, had made a valuable contribution to the implementation of their development programmes.
2. The participating countries agreed to provide technical assistance to one another, to the maximum extent practicable, in the form of: experts, trainces, pilot projects and equipment for demonstration purposes; exchange of know-how and establishment of national, and where possible, regional training and research institutes for importing technical knowledge and skills in cooperation with the existing international agencies.
3. The Asian-African Conference recommended: the early establishment of the Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development; the allocation by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of a greater part of its resources to Asian-African countries; the early establishment of the International Finance Corportion which should include in its activities the undertaking of equity investment; and encouragement to the promotion of joint ventures among Asian-African countries in sO far as this will promote their common interest.
4. The Asian-African Conference recognised the vital need for stabilizing commodity trade in the region. The principle of enlarging the scope of multilateral trade and payments was accepted. However, it was recognised that some countries would have to take recourse to bilateral trade arrangements in view of their prevailing economic conditions.

5. The Asian-African Conference recommended that collective action be taken by participating countries for stabilizing the international prices of and demand for primary commodities through bilateral and multilateral arrangements, and that as far as practicable and desirable, they should adopt a unified approach on the subject in the United Nations Permanent Advisory Commission on International Commodity Trade and other international forums.
6. The Asian-African Conference further recommended that: Asian-African countries should diversify their export trade by processing their raw material, wherever economically feasible, before export; intra-regional trade fairs should be promoted and encouragement given to the exchange of trade delegations and groups of businessmen; exchange of information and of samples should be encouraged with a view to promoting intra-regional trade; and normal facilities should be provided for transit trade of land-locked countries.
7. The Asian-African Conference attached considerable importance to Shipping and expressed concern that shipping lines reviewed from time to time their freight rates, often to the detriment of participating countries. It recommended a study of this problem, and collective action thereafter, to induce the shipping lines to adopt

d more reasonable attitude. It was suggested that a study of railway freight of transit trade may be made.
8. The Asian-African Conference agreed that encouragement should be given to the establishment of national and regional banks and insurance companies.
9. The Asian-African Conference felt that exchange of information on matters relating to oil, such as remittance of profits and taxation, might eventually lead to the formulation of common policies.
10. The Asian-African Conference emphasized the particular significance of the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, for the Asian-African countries. The Conference welcomed the initiative of the Powers principally concerned in offering to make available information regarding the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; urged the speedy establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency which should provide for adequate representation of the Asian-African countries on the executive authority of the Agency; and recommended to the Asian and African Governments to take full advantage of the training and other facilities in the peaceful uses of atomic energy offered by the countries sponsoring such programmes.

11. The Asian-African Conference agreed to the appointment of Liason Officers in participating countries, to be nominated by their respective national Governments, for the exchange of information and ideas on matters of mutual interest. It recommended that fuller use should be made of the existing international organisations, and participating countries who were not members of such international organisations, but were eligible, should secure membership.
12. The Asian-African Conference recommended that there should be prior consultation of participating countries in international forums with a view, as far as possible, to furthering their mutual economic interest. It is, however, not intended to form a regional bloc.
B. CULTURAL COOPERATION.

1. The Asian-African Conference was convinced that among the most powerful means of promoting understanding among nations is the development of cultural cooperation. Asia and Africa have been the cradle of great-religions and civilisations which have enriched other cultures and civilisations while themselves being enriched in the process. Thus the cultures of Asia and Africa are based on spiritual and universal foundations. Unfortunately contacts among Asian and African countries were interrupted during the past centuries. The peoples of Asia and Africa are now animated by a keen and sincere desire to renew their old cultural contacts and develop new ones in the context of the modern world. All participating governments at the Conference reiterated their determination to work for closer cultural cooperation.

2. The Asian-African Conference took note of the fact that the existence of colonialism in many parts of Asia and Africa in whatever form it may be not only prevents cultural cooperation but also suppresses the national cultures of the people. Some colonial powers have denied to their dependent peoples basic rights in the sphere of education and culture which hampers the development of their personality and also prevents cultural intercourse with other Asian and African peoples. This is particularly true in the case of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, where the basic right of the people to study their own language and culture has been suppressed. Similar discrimination has been practised against African and coloured people in some parts of the Continent of Africa. The Conference felt that these policies amount to a denial of the fundamental rights of man, impede cultural advancement in this region and also hamper cultural cooperation on the wider international plane. The Conference condemned such a denial of fundamental rights in the sphere of education and culture in some parts of Asia and Africa by this and other forms of cultural suppression.
In particular, the Conference condemned racialism as a means of cultural suppression.
3. It was not from any sense of exclusiveness or rivalry with other groups of nations and other civilisations and cultures that the Conference viewed the development of cultural cooperation among Asian and African countries. True to the age-old tradition of tolerance and universality, the Conference believed that Asian and African cultural cooperation should be developed in the larger context of world cooperation.

Side by side with the development of Asian-African cultural cooperation the countries of Asia and Africa desire to develop cultural contacts with others. This would enrich their own culture and would also help in the promotion of world peace and understanding.
4. There are many countries in Asia and Africa which have not yet been able to develop their educational. scientific and technical institutions. The Conference recommended that countries in Asia and Africa which are more fortunately placed in this respect should give facilities for the admission of students and trainees from such countries to their institutions. Such facilities should also be made available to the Asian and African people in Africa to whom opportunities for acquiring higher education are at present denied.
5. The Asian-African Conference felt that the promotion of cultural cooperation among countries of Asia and Africa should be directed towards:
(D the acquisition of knowledge of each others' country; (I1) mutual cultural exchange, and (ILI) exchange of information.

6. The Asian-African Conference was of opinion that at this stage the best results in cultural cooperation would be achieved by pursuing bilateral arrangements to implement its recommendations and by each country taking action on its own, wherever possible and feasible.
C.
HUMAN RIGHTS AND SELF DETERMINATION
1.
The Asian African Conference declared its full support of the fundamental principles of Human Rights as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and took note of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.
The Conference declared its full support of the principle of self-determination of peoples and nations as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and took note of the United Nations resolutions on the rights of peoples and nations to self-determination, which is a pre-requisite of the full enjoyment of all fundamental Human Rights. 2. The Asian-African Conference deplored the policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination which form the basis of government and human relations in large regions of Africa and in other parts of the world. Such conduct is not only a gross violation of human rights, but also a denial of the fundamental values of civilisation and the dignity of man.

The Conference extended its warm sympathy and support for the courageous stand taken by the victims of racial discrimination, especially by the peoples of African and Indian and Pakistani origin in South Africa; applauded all those who sustain their cause; re-affirmed the determination of Asian-African peoples to eradicate every trace of racialism that might exist in their own countries; and pledged to use its full moral influence to guard against the danger of falling victims to the same evil in their struggle to eradicate it.
D. PROBLEMS OF DEPENDENT PEOPLES.
1. The Asian-African Conference discussed the problems of dependent peoples and colonialism and the evils arising from the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation.
The Conference is agreed:
(a) in declaring that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil which should speedily be brought to an end:
(b) in affirming that the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and co-operation;

(c) in declaring its support of the cause of freedom and independence for all such peoples, and
(d) in calling upon the powers concerned to grant freedom and independence to such peoples.
2. In view of the unsettled situation in North Africa and of the persisting denial to the peoples of North Africa of their right to self-determination, the Asian-African Conference declared its support of the rights of the people of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to self-determination and independence and urged the French Government to bring about a peaceful settlement of the issue without delay.
E. OTHER PROBLEMS.
1. In view of the existing tension in the Middle East, caused by the situation in Palestine and of the danger of that tension to world peace, the Asian-African Conference declared its support of the rights of the Arab people of Palestine and called for the implementation of the United Nations Resolutions on Palestine and the achievement of the peaceful settlement of the Palestine question.
2. The Asian-African Conference, in the context of its expressed attitude on the abolition of colonialism, supported the position of Indonesia in the case of West Irian based on the relevant agreements between Indonesia and the Netherlands.

The Asian-African Conference urged the Netherlands Government to reopen negotiations as soon as possible, to implement their obligations under the above-mentioned agreements and expressed the earnest hope that the United Nations would assist the parties concerned in finding a peaceful solution to the dispute.
3. The Asian-African Conference supported the position of Yemen in the case of Aden and the Southern parts of Yemen known as the Protectorates and urged the parties concerned to arrive at a peaceful settlement of the dispute.
F. PROMOTION OF WORLD PEACE AND
COOPERATION.
1. The Asian-African Conference, taking note of the fact that several States have still not been admitted to the United Nations, considered that for effective cooperation for world peace, membership in the United Nations should be universal, called on the Security Council to support the admission of all those States which are qualified for membership in terms of the Charter. In the

opinion of the Asian-African Conference, the following among participating countries, viz.: Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan, Jordan, Libya, Nepal, a unified Vietnam were sO qualified.
The Conference considered that the representation of the countries of the Asian-African region on the Security Council, in relation to the principle of equitable geographical distribution, was inadequate. It expressed the view that as regards the distribution of the non-permanent seats. the Asian-African countries which, under the arrangement arrived at in London in 1946, are precluded from being elected, should be enabled to serve on the Security Council, so that they might make a more effective contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security.
2. The Asian-African Conference having considered the dangerous situation of international tension existing and the risks confronting the whole human race from the outbreak of global war in which the destructive power of all types of armaments, including nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, would be employed, invited the attention of all nations to the terrible consequences that would follow if such a war were to break out.

The Conference considered that disarmament and the prohibition of the production, experimentation and use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons of war are imperative to save mankind and civilisation from the fear and prospect of wholesale destruction. It considered that the nations of Asia and Africa assembled here have a duty towards humanity and civilisation to proclaim their support for disarmament and for the prohibition of these weapons and to appeal to nations principally concerned and to world opinion, to bring about such disarmament and prohibition.
The Conference considered that effective international control should be established and maintained to implement such disarmament and prohibition and that speedy and determined efforts should be made to this end.
Pending the total prohibition of the manufacture of nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons, this Conference appealed to all the powers concerned to reach agreement to suspend experiments with such weapons.
The Conference declared that universal disarmament is an absolute necessity for the preservation of peace and requested the United Nations to continue its efforts and appealed to all concerned speedily to bring about the regulation, limitation, control and reduction of all armed forces and armaments, including the prohibition of the production, experimentation and use of all weapons of mass destruction, and to establish effective international Fit control to this end.

G. DECLARATION ON THE PROMOTION OF WORLD PEACE AND COOPERATION The Asian-African Conference gave anxious thought to the question of world peace and cooperation. It viewed with deep concern the present state of international tension of with its danger of an atomic world war. The problem peace is correlative with the problem of international security. In this connection, all States should cooperate, especially through the United Nations, in bringing about the reduction of armaments and the elimination of nuclear weapons under effective international control. In this way, international peace can be promoted and nuclear energy may be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. This would help answer the needs particularly of Asia and Africa, for what they urgently require are social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. Freedom and peace are interdependent. The right of self-determination must be enjoyed by all peoples, and freedom and independence must be granted, with the least possible delay, to those who are still dependent peoples. Indeed, all nations should have the right freely to choose their own political and economic systems and their own way of life, in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
Free from mistrust and fear, and with confidence and goodwill towards each other, nations should practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours and develop friendly cooperation on the basis of the following principles:

1. Respect for fundamental human rights and for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations.
2. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.

3.
Recognition of the equality of all races and of the equality of all nations large and small.
4. Abstention from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of another country. nation to defend 5. Respect for the right. of each itself singly or collectively, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.
6.
(a) Abstention from the use of arrangements. of collective defence to serve the particular interests of any of the big powers.
(b)
Abstention by any country from exerting pressures on other countries.
7. Refraining from acts or threats of aggression or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country.
8. Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means, such as negotiation, conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement as well as other peaceful means of the parties' own choice, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.
9. Promotion of mutual interests and cooperation.
10. Respect for justice and international obligations. The Asian and African Conference declares its conviction that friendly cooperation in accordance with these principles would effectively contribute to the maintenance and promotion of international peace and security, while cooperation in the economic, social and cultural fields would help bring about the common prosperity and

well-being of all.
The Asian-African Conference recommended that the five sponsoring countries consider the convening of the next meeting of the Conference, in consultation with the participating countries.
Bandung, 24 April, 1955",communique,,,,
"Your Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends.
Having arrived now after a momentous week, at the close of this Conference, I should like to thank you all for the spirit of goodwill and the willingness to understand you have shown SO clearly and continuously during our fruitful discussions. It was this spirit and this willingness which made it possible to cooperate and arrive at good

results, and, if you permit me a personal note, which made it a pleasure for me to be in the chair.
Many of you have just honoured me with your praise for which I am most grateful. I feel, however, that these laurels do not belong to me alone.
There are many who have made great efforts to make this Conference successful. It is difficult to single out persons, committees or groups, but I feel that we are in

particular indebted to the other sponsoring countries, the Joint Secretariat, the Chairmen of our Committees and our Rapporteur to whom we owe so much for preparing this Conference and for the smooth running of its machinery.
As for myself, I have tried to discharge myself of my duties as your President to the best of my abilities by applying the rules of procedure as flexibly as possible. It may have happened, however, that I did not always succeed in giving everybody the full share to which he deemed himself entitled.
For this I express my regret which I trust you will accept in the same good spirit of friendship which prevailed during the days we were together and for which I am most grateful.
When on the 18th of April we met at our first session many of us were strangers to each other. We gathered from all parts of the wide continents of Asia and Africa for the basic purpose, as it was put in the Memorandum of the five sponsoring countries, to become better acquainted with one another's point of view. We had the hope in our hearts that this acquaintance would lead to something more, something of value which would benefit not only the peoples of Asia and Africa. but also the world at large.
There were, however, doubts as well.

Would we really be able, more than one of US must have asked himself, to fufil our aim by making a real contribution to the promotion of world peace and cooperation? Were we not aiming too high ? Would the differences in political, social and cultural outlook amongst such a great diversity of countries not prove to be an insurmountable obstacle to such a contribution. or even tO fruitful discussion '
Now, at the end of that same week, we can answer these doubts convincingly. We have not disappointed all those who did put their trust in us. We have made it clear that the peoples of Asia and Africa stand for peace. Before us and before the world is the joint-communique which we adopted a few minutes ago unanimously.
This document which. I am certain, will take its rightful place in world history, is the result of our labours and exchange of views. It will not be easy for anyone who has not followed our discussions closely to estimate the degree of mutual understanding and good will which was needed to arrive at this result.
It is obvious, however, that it would not have been possible to bring forward a document of this importance voicing the unanimous opinions and resolutions of more than half of the world's population, were it not that the

statesmen gathered here are men of peace and wisdom, able and willing to work together in order to give the world genuine peace for which it craves SO much.
Moreover, this document would not have come into being if we had not practised amongst ourselves democracy in its best form. During our many discussions we agreed and disagreed, but ultimately we always succeeded in finding a common ground.
Thus our meeting grew to something more and better than a mere conference. We arrived at a mutual understanding through an atmosphere of cordiality and frankness. We came to believe in our own ability to make a valuable contribution to world peace, although we viewed our common aims from different angles.
If I call our joint-communique a historic document it is because we may expect that our opinion will carry weight not only in our continents but even more so over the whole world.
I should therefore like to emphasize that in drafting our recommendations and decisions we never restricted ourselves to the sole interest of our own countries but endeavoured to put the problem in a wider frame, asking ourselves how to reduce world-tension.
1 most sincerely hope that when the rest of the world is taking due notice of our decisions they will do so in the same spirit of goodwill, tolerance, forbearance and wisdom as was so admirably displayed during this conference.

Not merely political problems had our attention. Your joint-communique gives proof that we devoted much of our limited time to economic and cultural issues and agreed wherever we could find common ground.
Upon returning to your homes and countries I am certain that all will carry with you the same gratifying feelings which are mine at the close of the first AsianAfrican Conference. We the peoples of Asia and Africa have shown that we can cooperate and that it iS peace and peace above all which we want for the benefit of our peoples and the whole world. We have gained much for ourselves and for millions of others during our gathering.
There have been many friendships formed during these days, many useful contacts have been made. We nOw know amongst ourselves that we want to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours as the only sure and real basis on which mankind can prosper.
May we continue on the way we have taken together and may the Bandung Conference stay as a beacon guiding the future progress of Asia and Africa.",general,,Ali Sastroamidjojo,,
"The Conference in Retrospect

""It's been .1 week of hectic hard work, but it's been worth it"" is a common remark this week end amongst the 2000 at the Conference.
At Colombo in April-May, 1954, Premier All Sastroamidjojo of Indonesia brought forward the idea of an Asian-African Conference. The five Premiers at Colombo discussed the desirability of holding such a conference, and favoured the proposal that the Prime Minister of Indonesia should explore the possibility of holding it. Later in the same year the Prime Ministers of India and Burma joined with Premier Ali in making public statements in favour of the conference. Abroad, however, not much heed was being paid. ""Afro-Asia"", aS the press christened the idea, was thought little more than a slogan. In December came the Bogor Conference. The five Prime Ministers could agree on the purposes that the Asian-African Conference would have, they could agree on the nations to be invited. It was decided that the Conference should be held and that invitations should be sent out.

Asian and African countries began to show interest in the idea, but, at least in some cases, scepticism still remained. Externally, the idea was often ridiculed.
But there were still many difficulties in the way of success. How many of the 30 countries invited would actually accept when the time came ? Could Indonesia, could Bandung, provide facilities for such a gathering ? Could there be guarantees of Indonesia's ability to ensure the maintenance of security ? These and many others were the doubts expressed in the Asian and African countries, as in the outside world.
Some doubts were dispelled when it was clear that 29 of the invitations had been accepted, but many queries remained until the very eve of the Conference, especially in the non-invited countries.
With the arrival of the delegates in Bandung, however, doubts began to be dispelled rapidly. Externally, opinion was faced with the fact that the countries invited had accepted, and that the delegations did arrive. This in itself could be seen to constitute success for the idea.

In Bandung, accommodation and transport, conference buildings and press facilities, were ready to function effectively. Furthermore, the security measures which had been taken gave no one the feeling of being restricted in his movements. Crowds and excitement notwithstanding, the atmosphere was was remarkably normal. The Indonesians could see immediately that the preparations which had been made by the Joint Secretariat, aided by various

agencies of the Indonesian Government, were nothing 10 be shamed of. The overseas visitors were generous in the comparisons they made.
On Monday morning the Conference began. Delegation after Delegation passed down the decked streets, and walked up LO the main Conference hall between the press of people which lined the cleared roads.
The note struck by the two main addresses, of President Sukarno and the newly-elected Conference President All Sastroamidjojo, was humanity in its highest and widest sense. A number of those present compared the atmosphere with that in the carly days of the League of Nations and at the time of the signing of the Atlantic Charter.
The hope which the addresses created was stimulated further by a number of practical decisions made quickly. One was the decision that the Conference should work by unanimous agreement, rather than by decisions arrived at by voting and a simple or two-thirds majority. Another was the agreement that there should be no political committee, as earlier envisaged, but a series of less formal meetings of Delegation Heads.

In the following days, a number of the difficulties which had been predicted made themselves felt. In the opening plenary addresses of some of the Delegation Heads, and later, reportedly, in closed meetings of the Economic and Cultural Committees and in those of the Heads of Delegations, the differences of policy long known to exist between various of the participating countries expressed themselves, sometimes very forcibly.
In discussions on what constituted colonialism, on ""peaceful co-existence"" and the well-knownFive Principles, and on a number of particular regional issues, the points of view adopted were often in contradiction to one another. There was some degree of justification for the pessimism of much of the reporting of the Conference at this stage, but there was misreading of the situation in so far as it was reported as a portent of the failure of the Conference. It did prove possible to keep the work of Conference moving forwards.

At the end of the Conference, the mood is a very different one. Among the delegates and visitors in general, and the representatives of the sponsoring countries in particular, there exists widespread satisfaction at the 05tensible results of the Conference.
Of notable importance is the fact that, on every occasion where partisan feeling on a particular issue became intense, the good offices of one or another leader of the Conference were able to prevent the creation of

an impasse. This in itself is a reflection of the atmosphere of goodwill, and of the serious desire for mutual compromise and agreement in the face of the urgency of the situation, which was present on all sides.
A number of developments, not actually part of the Conference but clearly a contribution towards its aims, have helped to mould the atmosphere of hope. One of these is the signing of the China-Indonesia Treaty on Dual Nationality, which took place on Friday. Another is the Treaty of Friendship between Indonesia and Afghanistan, which was signed on Sunday morning.
The last working session of the Conference, which lasted for virtually the whole of Sunday, produced no easy agreement. But the fact is that it did produce agreement. Moreover it produced a great deal of satisfac-

tion among the delegates, As the working session closed, with the adoption of a vote of thanks to the President, Secretariat, and Rapporteur, the delegates all looked happy.
The results of the Conference cannot, of course, be measured at the present time. Clearly one of the most important ways in which it was to achieve its objectives was that of informal contacts and discussions, some of which are no doubt still going on, and the outcome of which is necessarily undisclosed. Such contacts have certainly been established on a great many levels, including the highest.
History, of which the delegates at Bandung were so consistently conscious, will judge the significance of the
Conference.",general,,,,
"CHINA PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE WITH U. S. TO RELIEVE TAIWAN TENSION

In a statement made on April 23rd. Chou En-lai, Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, said that China is prepared to discuss with the United States of America the relaxation of tension the Far East, especially in the Taiwan (Formosa) area.
The text of the short statement reads:
""The Chinese people are friendly to the American people. The Chinese people do not want to have a war with the United States of America.
*The Chinese Government is willing to sit down and

enter into negotiations with the United States Government to discuss the question of relaxing tension in the Far East, and especially the question of relaxing tension the Taiwan area.' This statement was made by Chou En-lai at the Bandung residence of Conference President Ali Sastroamidjojo, where Heads of some of of some of the Delegations to the Conference had gathered to discuss how tension might be reduced in the Far East. Delegations represented were : Burma, Ceylon, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand.",general,,,,
"""Suara Merdeka"" of Semarang in Central Java wrote on 22nd April that one of the ideas which could smoothen the proceedings of the Bandung Conference is the understanding that the participating nations are in the first place Asian and African nations whose ways of thinking and destinies are not far different from one another. We can therefore reasonably expect that the Conference can arrive at concrete decisions regarding matters which can be carried out jointly.
If the Conference can produce tangible results, we are convinced that other conferences of Asian and African peoples to discuss problems of a more profound character can follow in the future. These conferences, the paper believed, could change the stand on fundamental principles of the nations now taking part in the Bandung Conference. ""Indonesia Raya"" of Djakarta was of the opinion countries, there were that despite the seemingly large number of participating for enough points a common stand fo of general agreement be taken in coping with the controversies faced by the great powers today.

Saying that nearly all the participants have once been colonised by Western countries, the paper pointed out that political independence is not enough. Economic independence is also important.
In the opinion of the paper a common stand on the question of preventing wars will not easily be reached. as most of the participating countries are bound militarily to the great powers. Nonetheless, ""Indonesia. Raya"" said, the idea of preserving and promoting world peace will have the support of every delegation.
Writing in the same vein, ""Thien Sung Yit Po"", a Chinese language paper published in Djakarta, was of the opinion that owing to the different stands of the participating countries it will be difficult to come to unanimous agreement on practical questions, especially those relating to politics.
The paper termed the Conference ""an epoch-making event in the world history"" but regretted that some Asian and African countries, such as Israel, Formosa and Korea, had not been invited.

""Harian Rakjat"" of Djakarta (English commented as follows : languange) *From many places in Indonesia messages were sent by the masses expressing their hopes that the Bandung Conference decide to demand the banning of the use and manufacture of atomic weapons.
""We are sure that these hopes are not only Indonesian hopes: These hopes are the hopes of Asia and Africa. of even the whole world.
*There are not words enough to depict the extent of the catastrophes which might be brought about if atomic weapons were used in any war, though President Eisenhower tried to cover it up with phrases such as *the tactical use of atomic weapons"".
""Adlai Stevenson was right when in stating the alternative. he chose the formulation ""co-existence or ""noexistence"".
""But no existence for whom ?
""For mankind? For the world? For our whole civilisation?
""This cannot happen !
*Our strength and unity are too great to be wiped out together with imperialism.

""If an atomic war were yet to break out, the results would certainly be no-existence for imperialism ""Let the imperialists, our hereditary enemies, make this choice if they prefer.
""But for us, why should we prefer existence with sacrifice to existence without sacrifice. Let us choose the latter ! Let us make it from a possibility into a fact! “The delegates who are now conferring at Bandung are in a position to do much in this respect.""",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"*The Times""* of London on 21st April reported that the high hopes of the Conference had been shattered and the fears reduced. It commented that if the Conference had marked any swing in allegiances, SO far it had been in accretions to the neutralist forces. ""The Times"" continued that probably the most important work of the Conference was being done in its social gatherings through introductions between Asian premiers who had never met before.
The London daily ""Telegraph"" admitted that there was less anti-Westernism displayed by the Conference than it had expected.

*The Manchester Guardian"" referred to the favourable aspects of the opening stages. This paper said that differences over communism were overridden by the feeling that Afro-Asianism was more important, and that the

danger that communists might dominate the Conference had been averted by the moderate course adopted by
Chou En-lai.
The most impressive feature of the Conference. the Manchester Guardian went on to say, was the widespread hope that Asian non-resistance was more powerful than the dependence of the industrialised powers on military weapons. ""This neutralism which is inherent in every weak nation"", the paper said, ""becomes an incalculably powerful factor now that two continents, which hitherto have been despised, have found how much they have in common.
*The Economist"" on 19th April reported a comment by G. Adam, who held that the Conference was mainly the work of Indonesia, probably in order to distract attention from her home troubles. But the result was historic because such a gathering of coloured statesmen had never happened before.

Adam said that it was interesting to sce the role of China in the Conference where Russia was not present. Chou En-lai had a good platform for propaganda, but the Turks, Iraqis, Pakistanis, and possibly the Japanese were preventing him from dominating the Conference, and were in a position to strike a blow for freedom. it is to be neither war nor communist imperialism, the East and West must learn to work together, and neither of them can live on their own, the report states. The ""Economist"" article concludes by saying that the test of the Bandung Conference will be whether it makes such co-operation easier or more difficult.
The ""News Chronicle"" contains an article by James Cameron who expresses the opinion that the destiny of man has shifted a few points from its course, which. he remarks, may be a good thing in the end. He says : ""It is odd to think that probably the century's most momentous political meeting so nearly (SO far as wo anc concerned missed the boat altogether.""
""*The Afro-Asian Conference has been sweating it out in an atmosphere of drama, super-tension, exhilaration, anxiety and self-consious wonder"". Delegates have one thing in common, he says, and that is that they are neither European nor American and their skins are not technically white. But, for the moment, without a shadow of a doubt these representatives are the most important people alive.

The Conference is anti-colonial, the report continues, but it shows no signs of being anti-American.-President Sukarno's address on the opening day is described aS ""genuinely moving"", The article concludes by remarking that although hard facts are scarce, the significant point is that one half of the world's population has found voice of a kind and that is one of the biggest things that has happened in our time.",press,,,Europe,
"Mr. President, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and
Gentlemen !
The Asian-African Conference has come to a successful end. On this occasion I wish to express my thanks to the governments of all the sponsoring countries, particularly to the government of the Republic of Indonesia. My thanks also go to the members of the Secretariat and everyone who has helped us in our work. Most particularly I would like to request you, Mr. President, to convey the message of our heartfelt thanks to the people of Indonesia. We are deeply touched by their warm sentiments and we feel extremely grateful to them. We shall always remember them and their beautiful country.
To this Conference we came with great hopes and I am happy to state that we depart with greater hopes. The Conference proved that all of us, from different parts of Asia and Africa, have felt and acted as one, for the achievement of our common desire for promotion of better understanding, preservation of peace and protection of human rights.

We are happy that in all our discussions the principles of the United Nations have been supported. We hope that this Conference will strengthen the position of the United Nations Organization in its high aims for the welfare of humanity.
We are glad to see that there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the deliberations of this Conference will make a great contribution to the situation in the world as a whole. This contribution, based on the co-operation of a great part of the world, and with the support of the majority of the population of the world, undoubtedly deserves the historic significance attached to it.
Mr. President, before I conclude wish to thank you for your great efforts for making this Conference a success. You have presided over our sessions with great patience, statesmanship and impartiality, in a distinguished manner. I can say that all this has been appreciated by every one of us.
Thank you.",address,,"Sardar Mohammad Naim, Afghanistan",,Closing

First and foremost, I wish to say how very grateful we are to the Government of Indonesia, and particularly to its distinguished President and Prime Minister, for their lavish hospitality, and for the excellence of their arrangements both in regard to the Conference itself, and to our individual comfort and convenience. Those of us who have had the experience of playing host to international gatherings know that the responsibilities assumed by the Government of

Indonesia were extremely onerous. The smoothness with which the Conference operated, from start to finish, is an eloquent tribute to the careful planning and able execution on the part of our host Government.
Secondly, I would like to place on record our appreciation of the able, impartial and statesmanlike manner in which our deliberations were guided by our distinguished
Chairman, my good friend, Dr. Ali Sastroamidjojo. would like to say how grateful we are to our eminent Rapporteur, His Royal Highness Prince Wan Waithayakon, for giving us the benefit of his vast experience, and doing

it with such good understanding and cheer. For a Conference of this magnitude to have run through our extremely ambitious agenda in a week is no mean achievement. I know I speak for all of us when I say that it would not have been possible but for the guidance and assistance of these two distinguished gentlemen.
Thirdly, I cannot let this occasion pass without referring to the extremely cordial welcome and reception accorded to us by this charming city of Bandung. shal always carry with me a warm recollection of the crowds lining the streets, the smiling faces and the cheers of the children. At the end of a long day, it was always a heartwarming experience. It was just as though we had been at home in Burma all the time.
And now a few words about the Conference itself. The Conference has not, of course, come to any earthshaking or epoch-making decisions. But this is hardly surprising or unexpected. Indeed, that was net its purpose, which was to get together the leaders of the independent countries of Asia and Africa sO that they might exchange views on matters of common interest and concern. This we have done. Our discussions have revealed the existence of diversities, and even differences of opinion among us. But this was only to be expected, considering the vast geographical area from which the delegates were drawn, each with his own beliefs, traditions and backgrounds.

Even though we could not reach epoch-making decisions, the fact that we could, freely and frankly, air our differences is a useful thing in itself. Such an exchange cannot fail to produce better understanding as between ourselves. In this troubled world, beset with suspicion, mistrust and misunderstanding, the achievement of even a little better understanding in any part of it must be regarded as a move towards stability and peace.
Another factor which precluded the reaching of historic decisions is the fact that most of us represented here are in no position to exercise such influence on the course of world events. We could have passed highsounding resolutions here, but the world despite the fact that we represent nearly two-thirds of its population would have taken little notice of them. This is due

to our general weakness, and here I refer not to military weakness alone. The lesson to be drawn from this is that we must, all of us, develop our internal strength before we can expect to have a more effective say in the running of the affairs of this planet of ours.
Some of the subjects discussed were highly controversial. Some of the remarks made could have been regarded as provocative even if that was not the intention. It is no secret that at times the Conference reached what seemed a deadlock. But nevertheless, the moderation, the patience, the perseverance and the skill displayed by the distinguished delegates enabled us to find our way out of them and to reach common ground. In this sense, the Conference was a concrete demonstration of peaceful co-existence.

For many of us this was our first experience of an international Conference of this size. I think it will have proved to be a valuable experience. For a variety of reasons, which I need not enumerate here, most of us have, in the past, tended to live in little worlds of our own. Such knowledge as we had of the outside world was theoretical. Participation in this Conference has brought home to us the practical realisation that there is a world outside our own borders; a world, even in Asia and Africa, of diversity diversity of belief, tradition, background and outlook. We learned that problems which to us appeared simple and straightforward had a different appearance to our friends, and we learned to appreciate the need for taking into account their attitudes and feelings, and to make adjustments. In other words, it was a lesson in human relations and human nature applied to the international sphere.
In conclusion, I should like to say that it has been an honour and a privilege for me to meet so many of the distinguished leaders of Asia and Africa at this Conference. I have been impressed by the erudition of many of the speeches and the wisdom which they reflect. If only the world would respond to the ideas and suggestions which underlie these speeches, at least part of the existing tensions and suspicions would be removed.
In bidding you farewell, I wish each and every one of you a safe and speedy return to your homes.",address,,"U Nu, Burma",,Closing
"Honorable Chairman, Distinguished Delegates !
Our Conference has made achievements. First of all on behalf of the Chinese delegation, I would like to thank the five Colombo Powers for their initiative in sponsoring this Conference; to our hosts, the President, the people and Government of the Republic of Indonesia, for their warm hospitality; to the Chairman of our Conference, the Prime

Minister of Indonesia, for conducting the affairs of the Conference so ably and all his efforts to make it a success; to all the delegations for their co-operation, and the Joint Secretariat of the Conference and all those who have taken part in the work of the Conference for their valuable contribution.
The achievements of the Conference lie in the fact that

had understanding among Asian and African countries has a good start or been further promoted and agreements on some major issues have been brought about in this Conference. These achievements will be of great help to our common task of opposing colonialism, safeguarding world peace and promoting friendly co-operation between us. This Conference has to a considerable extent satisfied the aspirations of the peoples of Asia and Africa, as well of the world.
This conference has also reflected the fact that our approaches to and our views on many questions are different, We have also discussed in part our differences. However, such different approaches and views did not prevent us from achieving common agreements. We have been able to make such achievements in opposing colonialism, safeguarding world peace, and promoting political, economic and cultural co-operation, because we peoples of the Asian and African countries share the same fate and the same desires.
I For the same reason, I would like to declare once again that the Chinese people extend their full sympathy and support to the struggle of the peoples of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia for self-determination and independence, to the struggle of the Arab people of Palestine for human

the restoration of Indonesia's sovereignty over West Irian, and rights, to the struggle of the Indonesian people for to the just struggle for national independence and the people's freedom waged by all the peoples of Asia and
Africa to shake off colonialism.
I want to point out further that the Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and Co-operation adopted by the Conference will help to relax the international tension and, first of all, the tension in the Far East. It is our view that the full implementation of the agreements. on the restoration of peace in Indo-China should be guaranteed by the parties concerned. As to the peaceful unification of Korea, the parties concerned should speedily seek the solution through negotiation. China and the United States should sit down and enter into negotiation to settle the question of relaxing and eliminating the tension in the Taiwan area. However, this should not in the slightest degree affect the just demand of the Chinese people to exercise their sovereign rights in liberating Taiwan.
Finally, I hope that the contacts among the Asian and African Continents and the friendly intercourse between our peoples will become more frequent from now on.
I wish all the delegates good health and bon voyage on their return journey. Goodbye",address,,"Chou En-lai, China",,Closing
"Mr. President, Fellow Delegates Our Conference is drawing to a close after eight days of friendly and fruitful deliberations. These eight days have been preceded by extensive preparations and work by the Joint Secretariat which was of great help indeed. There is no doubt that our Conference has achieved a tremendous success, because international peace and cooperation will be greatly helped by the solidarity and harmony revealed in the decisions taken by our Conference. The cause of freedom will be greatly inspired by the deep concern and full support which all the Asian and African countries have shown with regard to the question of human rights and self-determination.
Mr. President, much of the credit for the success of

this Conference goes to you personally, to your personal experience and your patience, and to the patient and the salutary and friendly spirit in which the various delegations held their deliberations, particularly at times when disagreements and dissensions looked inevitable, and to your remarkable and masterful conduct of the affairs of the Conference; the wonderful facilities provided by the Indonesian Government and the generous hospitality shown by the Indonesian people, not only were of great help to our work, but also made our stay here most pleasant.
May I also take this opportunity to thank once more the five sponsoring governments for the appreciative efforts in taking the initiative to convene this Conference.
Thank you.",address,,"Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt",,Closing
"Mr. President
For seven days we have been in this pleasant city of Bandung, and Bandung has been the focal centre perhaps might even say the capital of Asia and this period, Africa during

We have met here, but what have we accomplished ? know, we have been successful in We have laboured for these seven days and, as you all problems, solving our common because political and economical. We have all met here irrepressible we were conscious of the fact that there is an urge amongst the people of Asia and Africa

to meet here. We met because mighty forces are at work in these great continents moving millions of people, creating in their minds urges and passion and desire for a change in their dependent conditions. So, however big we might be, we have these great forces at work. So we met; and what have we achieved? Well, you have seen the draft statement which has been read out to you and I think it represents a considerable achievement. Other delegates have referred to it and you will read it too; should like to draw your attention, to direct your minds, not to the statement which is an important statement, no doubt, but rather to the importance of the fact that we have met together here from thousands of miles away, conferred together, seen each other, argued with each other to solve our common problems and thereby made friends with each other.

My friend, the honourable Prime Minister of Burma, referred to our diversities of opinion as our differences and we wrestled with each other for these seven days because we wanted to adopt a common opinion and common outlook. Obviously, the world looks different from whichever angle you may try to look at it. If you are sitting in the far East of Asia, you have a different perspective of the world and world's problems. If you are sitting In far Western Asia, you have a different perspective again, and if you are In Africa, naturally the problems of Africa will be quite different. So, we all came with our own perspectives, with our own problems, considering each one his own problem the most important in the world, but, at the same time, trying to understand big problems of the world as also the second big problem of Asia and Africa and trying somehow to fit in our problems in this larger context because in the ultimate analysis, all our problems, however important they might be, cannot be approved along with these larger problems and can hardly be solved unless those larger problems are settled. Thus, how will you solve this problem or that problem if peace itself is in danger and thrown overboard? Obviously, you cannot. So, our primary consideration is peace. You and I sitting here in our respective countries are patently eager to advance our countries peacefully. We have been backward; we are backward. We have been left behind in the race, in the world race, and now we have got a chance again to make good. We want to make good and we have to make good rapidly because of the compulsion of events. It iS not so much a choice of your own or mine, but the

choice dictated by this compulsion of events, because if we do not make good, we will fade away or we stay where we are today not to rise again for a long time to come. Surely, we are not going to do that; we are determined not to do that. We are determined in this new chapter of Asia and Africa to make good. We are determined not, primarily, to be dominated in any way by any other country Or continent. We are determined to rise again to our full stature. It is time for us to bring happiness and prosperity to our people and to put an end to all the age-old shackles that tied us not only politically you may call them shackles of colonialism, but shackles that are of our own making but economically.
There have been differences, no doubt, in our discussions and it is a fact that there was greatest criticism levelled on certain resolutions; we had to advance such criticism because we wanted to achieve a common goal. I know we directed such criticism against ourselves because we thought that it is not the resolutions that will solve our problems facing us today, but it is our practices and actions that will bring success to our aims and ideals. It is only then, and then alone, that we can make good what we have lost in the past. We have to take a realistic view of all things and face them in a realistic spirit too.
But, there is yet another spirit of Asia today. As we all know, Asia is no longer passive today; it had been passive enough in the past. It is no more a submissive Asia; it has tolerated submissiveness for so long. Asia of today is dynamic; Asia is full of life. Asia might make mistakes, and has made mistakes in the past, but it does not matter so long as life is there in it. We can make advances, if life is there, but if there is no life, all our right words, our right actions will not hold good, and whatever we have achieved will be lost. I think, our achievements have not only been great they have been very great and we have been in general agreement with all our resolutions, if may say SO but much greater has been the background of all these agreements because

when I said we have wrestled with problems, we have wrestled with our differences, we have argued till, should say, fatigue overtook all our bodies and minds and finally in spite of those differences, we have agreed and that 1S the main thing. We are not 'yes-men' I hope, sitting here saying ""Yes"" to this country or that, saying ""Yes"" even to each other. I hope we are not. We are great countries in the world who rather like having freedom, if may say so, without dictation. Well, if there is anything that Asia wants to tell them it is this: no dictation there is going to be in the future; no 'yes-men' in Asia, I hope, or in Africa. We have had enough of that in the past. We value friendship of the great countries and if I am to play my part, I should like to say that we sit with the great countries of the world as brothers, be it in Europe or America. It is not in any spirit of hatred or dislike or aggressiveness with each other in regard to Europe or America. Certainly not. We send to them our greetings, all of us here and we want to be friends with them, to cooperate with them. But, we shall only cooperate in the future as equals; there is no friendship when nations are not equal, when one has to obey the other and when one dominates the other. That is why we raise our voice against domination and colonialism from which many of us have suffered sO long and that is why we have to be very careful to see that any other form of domination does

not come in our way. Therefore, we want to be friends with the West and friends with the East and friends with everybody because if there is something that may be called an approach to the minds and spirit of Asia, it is one of of toleration and friendship and cooperation; not one aggressiveness.
I wish to speak no ill of anybody. In Asia all of us have many faults as countries, as individuals. Our past history shows that. Nevertheless, I say that Europe has been in the past a continent full of conflict, full of trouble, full of hatred and their conflicts continue, their wars continue and we have been dragged in their wars because we were tied to their chariot wheels. Now, are we going to continue to be dragged and tie ourselves to Europe's troubles, Europe's hatreds and Europe's conflicts I hope not. Of course, Europe, Asia and America are all dependent on one another. It is perhaps not quite right to think in terms of isolation because we are not isolated, we have to live together and to cooperate with each other in this modern world which is going up towards the ideal of one world. Nevertheless, Europe has got into the habit of thinking, also other great countries in America whatever their political persuasions may be that their quarrels are the world's quarrels and therefore the world must submit to them this way or that way. Well, I do not quite follow that reasoning. I do not want anybody to quarrel in Europe, Asia Or America, but if at least others quarrel, why should I quarrel and why should I be dragged into their quarrels and wars ? T just do not understand it. Therefore, I hope we shall

keep away from those quarrels and exercise our will not to quarrel. I realise, as the Prime Minister of Burma said, that we cannot exercise tremendous influence over the world. Our influence will grow, no doubt; it is growing, and we can exercise some influence even today. But whether our influence is great Or small, it must be exercised in the right direction, in an intelligentdirection, in a direction which has integrity of purpose and ideals and objectives as shown in our Resolution. It represents the ideals of Asia, it represents the new dynamism of Asia, because if it does not represent that, what are we then ? Are we copies of Europeans or Americans or Russians ? What are we ? We are Asians Or Africans. We are none else. If

we are camp followers of Russia Or America or any other country of Europe, it is, if I may say so, not very creditable to our dignity, our new independence, our new self-reliance. freedom, our new spirit and our new So, we mean no ill to anybody. We send out our greetings to Europe and America. We send out greetings to Australia and New Zealand. And indeed Australia and New Zealand are almost In our region. They certainly do not belong to Europe, much less to America. They are next to us and I should like indeed Australia and New Zealand to come nearer to Asia. There they are. I would welcome them because I do not want what we sayor do to be based on racial prejudices. We have had enough of this racialism elsewhere. We have it today. We have passed many resolutions etc., about this country and that country. But I think there is nothing more terrible, there is nothing more horrible than the infinite tragedy of Africa in the past few hundred years. When I think of it everything else pales into insignificance that infinite tragedy of Africa ever since the days when millions of them were carried away in galleys as slaves to America and elsewhere, the way they were treated, the way they were taken away, 50% dying in the galleys. We have to bear that burden, all of us. We did not do it ourselves but the world has to bear it. We talk about this country and that little country in Africa or outside, but let us remember this Infinite Tragedy. But unfortunately, in a different sense, even now the Tragedy of Africa is greater than that of any other, I venture to say, even today.

Whether it is racial, whether it is political, whatever it may be, it is there and it iS up to Asia to help Africa, to the best of her ability, because we are sister continents. So, Sir, I trust that the achievement that we have had in this Conference has left, I am sure, its powerful impress on the minds of all who are here. I am sure that it has left an impress on the minds of the world. We came here, I repeat, conciously or unconciously as agents of historic destiny and we have made some history here. And we have to live up to what we have said and what we have thought and, even more so, to live up to what the world expects us, what Asia expects us, what the millions of these countries expect us. I hope we would be worthy of the peoples' faith and our destiny.",address,,"Jawaharlal Nehru, India",,Closing
"Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates !
May I-say a few words to express the profound gratitude of the Indonesian delegation for the goodwill and cooperation which it has experienced from all other delegations participating at this Conference of Asian and
African nations.

There were many speculations in the world press regarding the outcome of this Conference. Some were
It optimistic, but pessimistic views were prevailing in general. be the was expected that the Bandung Conference would battleground of conflicting points of view, of in failure. irreconcilable character so that the Conference would end But no, it became a great success.

In the course of the deliberations and discussions about the many agenda items, it soon became evident that the frank exchange of views brought forward with great eloquence, ability and precision among the delegates, has resulted in becoming better acquainted with the views of one another and therefore in mutual understanding. I would like to refer particularly to the item of vital importance to us all which is regarded by Indonesia as interpreting the very ""raison d'etre"", the common ground for big meetings like this between African-Asian nations, that is the passing of the resolution on colonialism and imperialism which has met with a general unanimous condemnation.
In this respect I am grateful for the full support of the Conference given to Indonesia regarding the issue of West-Irian. The problem of West-Irian is, as everybody knows, of vital significance for our country. This wholehearted and complete support of the Conference now, is a most important thing for us for which my Government and people are greatly indebted to all of you. A final settlement of the dispute with the Netherlands regarding this matter will certainly ease tensions in this part of the world and is conducive to gioval peace and international cooperation.
And then there is the other item of supreme importance to us all, that is world peace and world cooperation. We are aware of the fact that we are on our way to complete disaster if we don't find a more satisfying, i.e.,

peaceful approach to the problem of war and peace than has usually been done.
The world situation in which we find ourselvers today is, as the great leader of India has put it, largely due to the ""failure of world diplomacy."" The Asian and African nations are vitally concerned regarding the trend of the world historical process of development leading to wholesale destruction or peace.
If peace must be the outcome of the human efforts, then the Asian and African nations have to exert themselves, in contributing with all their energy, with all their might and determination, and, if necessary, with great sacrifices, to the realisation of that noble purpose of world peace, it means of genuine peace-, where there is no place anymore for fear or suspicion. Therefore, we should continuously endeavour from day to day to work constructively

for the avoidance of war, and for the harmonisation of conflicting interests. Our efforts should be directed in the spirit which has guided this Conference, that is the spirit of goodwill and cooperation, of mutual trust and common faith, which constitute an irresistable moral force. For in peace we can set our pace in the fulfilment of our tremendous task to build up our countries, to exploit our vast natural resources, to adapt ourseives to the requirements of science, technology and industry as the pillars of modern progress. In peace we can cultivate and develop our personalities as individual nations based on our material and spiritual achievements. In so doing we shall greatly contribute to the peaceful and constructive progress of mankind and world civilisation.
I would like to add for your information that two days ago, during this Conference, Indonesia was very fortunate to be able to conclude a treaty with the People's Republic of China on the solution of the longstanding double-nationality question, which problem is obviously important also for other countries in South East Asia.
This treaty was concluded between two Asian countries in the spirit of goodwill and tolerance which has guided the Asian-African Conference itself. Furthermore, during this Conference, informal talks have been resumed on the still pending question of a treaty concerning war reparations and future normal diplomatic relations with Japan which Indonesia hopes to be able to conclude with that country in the very near future and in this way con-

tributing again to the cooperation and peace In this part of the world. Those talks, too, were held in the atmosphere of harmony and hope which has prevailed during this Conference.
In conclusion, the Indonesian Delegation feels that besides all those successes registered at this Conference, Indonesia is most grateful for having the opportunity to establish, renew and strengthen her contacts with her neighbours. May this spirit of goodwill, neighbourliness and true cooperation be everlasting.
To our fellow delegates who are leaving Bandung very soon, the delegation' of Indonesia wishes to extend a most cordial good-bye and an au revoir till the next African-Asian Conference.
Thank you.",address,,"Sunario, Indonesia",,Closing
"Mr. Chairman, Fellow Delegates
It is difficult to hide one's emotion at a moment like this, when you feel that you were given the opportunity of

writing a page of history and you think that you have done your best to achieve it.
A week ago, in this same hall, I expressed the earnest hope of my delegation that mutual concessions would

bring the various views closer to each other to the best interest of all. On all issues unanimous agreement was reached. Such a unanimity, even if it was obtained on general principles, is a cause of rejoicing and pride, it is a clear manifestation of our common ideals of peace and freedom, our common will to resist and fight all forms of colonialism and subjugation.
During the Conference, the contact and the free exchange of opinions among us was of utmost importance for all of us. J do earnestly hope that it would be continued and thus help the promotion of closer political, economic and cultural collaboration in our two continents. As the necessity of this gathering was in great part dictated by the needs of a closer economic cooperation, we should especially endeavour that such economic relations would be promoted and contribute to the development of better understanding and more fruitful collaboration in all other fields.

Perhaps the aims of this Conference would be better served by a wider publicity. However, I should add that if we thought it necessary to confine ourselves to closed sessions, none of us here had in mind to underestimate the importance of the public opinion, we were only eager-to realize necessary conditions for the quickest possible way of exchanging views and coming to agreement without being hindered by undue publicity.
Also, I should like to express our deepest gratitude to the generous and inexhaustible hospitality of our host and promoters of the Conference who succeeded to realize all the means of material and spiritual comfort for all the delegates to the Conference. Our sincere thanks go to H.E. the President of the Republic of Indonesia and H.E.

the Indonesian Prime Minister under whose able leadership the Conference succesfully achieved its program. The enthusiasm and the sympathy of all the population of Bandung and the organizers of the Conference will always be remembered with deep affection.
Before concluding I would like to add a few more words. On this bright Sunday of the 24th of April, in the green city of Bandung, the A.A. Conference is proud, after a week of hard labour, to have given birth to a most cherished child: a child of future with no special name, no special colour, no special race, but with certain specific features in which we all, more or less, recognize ourselves. It is a child whose frail body symbolizes the sufferings and the privations of a cruel, though magnificent, past and whose insisting cries call upon the brightest morrows of mankind. It is a child whose hands seem already capable of giving shape to the most fantastic dreams of our forefathers. It is a child which it is our sacred duty to bring up with utmost care, love and wisdom.

History will recall the Bandung Conference as the first diplomatic manifestation of the Afro-Asian solidarity and our consciousness and determined will to begin a new era, the era of gradual emancipation from the enslaving old chains of fear and tyranny of ignorance and want. Today we are proclaiming to the whole world the awakening of our two continents a historical phenomenon of our time, our conviction that completely independent and free Afro-Asia is possible and can, by itself, achieve such a political, economic and social emancipation.
Long live the Afro-Asian solidarity ! Long live the fifteen hundred millions of brothers and sisters of our two continents !",address,,"Jalal Abdoh, Iran",,Closing
"Mr. President and Honourable Delegates !
At least two outstanding qualities characterised the spirit of the Bandung Conference. One is the cordiality and the friendly atmosphere with which we met each other and the second is the frankness, sincerity and clarity with which we expressed our respective points of view.
This Conference certainly broadened our international horizon and gave birth to new friendship and sympathies and fortified old ones.
It is natural that we should hold different point of view because we have different backgrounds, different problems; we have different philosophies and different ideologies. It is futile to ignore differences and disagreements. The important thing is to come together, to discuss and to know our points of agreement and act on them and to discover highly controversial issues like the

Taiwan and other such issues and avoid discussing them. We did our best, Mr. Chairman, under your able leadership to find many points of agreement. We unanimously agreed, for example, on subjects like Indonesia's right on West Irian, subjects like recognition of the rights of the Arabs-of Palestine to their own homes, subjects like liberation of the peoples of Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, and other subjugated peoples, wherever they may be. We agreed on the principle of self-determination of peoples. We agreed on disarmament and prohibition of nuclear weapons and on many other economic and cultural issues. This Conference will event. go in history as a It has been a great world successful one. For the success of a Conference depends on its atmosphere of friendship and with goodwill on the one hand and on its handling of the agenda thoroughness, objectivity and realism on the other.
These conditions were greatly fulfilled.

We are happy that our deliberations were guided by the United Nations Charter and this Conference supports and fortifies the United Nations.
Mr. Chairman, Indonesia will always be in the hearts and minds of all of us here. The people of Indonesia inspired us with love, kindness and good nature. We are grateful to His Excellency the President of the Republic of Indonesia, to you personally, Sir, to your Government and to the people of Indonesia in general and the inhabitants of the city of Bandung in particular. We are indebted to the Colombo Powers for initiating this Conference and for effectively carrying out its plan. We thank them most heartily.

May Allah lead us all in the path of brotherhood, happiness and peace for all mankind. May we all be inspired .by a verse from the holy Koran which I will read to you: Ya ayuhannasu Innaa khalaknakum min thakarin wa untha wa ja' alnaakum shu uban wa gabaila lita aarafu, inna akramakum 'indallahi atqaakum, innallaha aleemun khabeerun.

Allow me to express the heartfelt thanks of the Japanese delegation to the Government of the five sponsoring Powers especially the Government of the host country, the Republic of Indonesia for organising and steering the Asian-African Conference to. a successful conclusion.
I wish to tender my sincere congratulations to this eminent Conference on Its superb and splendid achievements and its powerful contributions towards the enhancement of friendship and understanding among the peoples of
Asia and Africa.
The deliberations of the past few weeks have sometimes revealed the existence of certain differences of opinion, it is true. But these have all been amicably settled and we feel greatly encouraged by the large areas of agreement that have been secured on our common problems, by the spirit of good fellowship and tolerance that throughout characterised the atmosphere of the Conference,

and by the common determination, fully demonstrated by all the participating delegations, to work together with the rest of the world, for the promotion of the peace and welfare of mankind. This Conference opens a new phase In the history of the world. In fact, it ushers in the much awaited dawn of Asian-African renaissance..
Ladies and gentlemen, the Japanese delegation going home feels happy to have taken part in this historic Conference with the distinguished delegations from the two continents and feels grateful for the kindness and hospitality of the warm-hearted people of Indonesia, and for the generous cooperation of you all.

"Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, Fellow Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen !
At this Closing moment of the Asian-African Conference, I raise my modest voice to convey to you the feeling of the delegation of Laos regarding the resolution we arrived at after all these days of continuous hard work. The delegation of Laos was following, with the greatest care and keenest interest, the long and protracted discussions raised by these important problems liberty, freedom, peace and welfare of the people, and my delegation fully supports the important resolutions

arrived at in this Conference. All those resolutions, dictated by a spirit of deep wisdom and the unanimous desire of the people of Asia and Africa to witness the opening of 2 new era of justice, mutual understanding and universal brotherhood, will be a landmark in the history of humanity. Perhaps pessimistic minds would regret that these timely and wise resolutions are not followed by appropriate steps so as to make them respected by all countries, big and small. However, we may feel proud of the results secured which, undoubtedly, constitute great step in the history of humanity. The spirit, the confidence. the solidarity is there and we hope that all people who are sincerely interested in peace will make it a moral obligation to fall in line with these principles and regulations, to the attainment of which they all contributed. We wish our best for the gathering of similar Conferences as often as possible. In this atmosphere once created and properly established, it is possible to develop mutual understanding and contribute 10 peaceful co-existence and collective security.
To conclude, may you allow me. Mr. Chairman.

Excellencies, and Fellow Delegates, to convey to the sponsoring countries our deep sense of thankfulness for the opportunity given us to take part in this historic InterContinental Conference and also to convey to the Government and people of Indonesia Our warm thanks for the lovely welcome given us in this beautiful and picturesque part of their country.

We first of all thank the five sponsoring Governments of this great continent of Asia for having given Liberia the opportunity of participating in this Conference. Undoubtedly it is a great event, this gathering together of nations of two continents, not for the purpose of planning war or exploitation, and so on, but for the purpose of getting together for a common understanding for peace and world security. It is a great occasion, of which I think not only the peoples of Asia but also the peoples of Africa should be proud.

We thank that great statesman of India, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, for his very sympathetic references to the continent of Africa and the African peoples. We appreciate and we realize that there is a deep feeling of humanity in that continent towards the peoples of Africa. We harbour no ill-feelings. We have wronged no one. Africa has the feeling that she has wronged no continent or no people. Whether she has been wronged is the question to be answered. A little searching of conscience will show that Africa has been wronged.
We realize that each people and each continent must make its own peculiar contribution to the great world economy, and although Europe and America have been concentrating on the achievement of material prosperity, we. the people of Africa, including my humble country Liberia, have directed our attention to the intangible things of life. That is Africa's peculiar contribution.

The tangible things are material and the material things are tangible. Today there are fleets, arms, great institutions, arising everywhere. They are tangible. But the intangible things that cannot be touched are everlasting. They are moral and spiritual values. It is with these things that our tWO continents must make our contribution to the world community. We do not say that material things do not count. No. What we do say is that undue emphasis should not be placed upon these material forces leaving the moral and immaterial things behind, because these are the things that matter in the final count. Nations are putting their faith on things material. Kings and empires have arisen, based on material foundations, but where are they today !

We must thank God for having had in our deliberations thoughts of this kind emanating from the great and leading statesmen of the East. In our deliberations we have had various feelings, sentiments of loyalty and so forth, but we met here with a declaration of goodwill to all men. And, Mr. President, on behalf of our country, we extend to you our thanks and appreciation for the courtesy you in such a have extended to us. for the invitation to us to participate world. great and epochal event in the history of the

direct the world, in our own way, to those intangible but everlasting truths of justice and righteousness.
We thank you.",address,,"Momolu Dukuly, Liberia",,Closing
"Mr. President, Fellow Delegates, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen !
This unique Conference of the nations of Asia and Africa is about to close. For seven days we, the representatives of the greater half of the people of the world, belonging to diverse faiths, races, cultures and civilizations, have united our efforts to promote the aims of justice, equality freedom and peace for all the peoples of the world. To you, Mr. President, and your associates on whom fell the main burden of arranging this Conference, the peoples of Asia and Africa owe a debt of gratitude for this remarkable assembly of twenty-nine nations in the beautiful city of Bandung. In convening this Conference in Indonesia you undertook a major task. The manner in which you people have discharged this heavy burden, and the hospitality and courtesy we have received everywhere have evoked the praise and admiration of all of us. To me, as it must have been to my fellow delegates, this Conference has been a memorable one. To have personally met SO many topranking statesmen of two continents and exchanged views with them on the burning issues which trouble the peace

and tranquility of the world has been an enriching experience.
I shall not in my valedictory remarks dwell on the accords reached by us or the questions we have discussed in our meetings. I shall, however, say that it is most remarkable that in spite of the diversity of interests and Our respective approaches to world problems and divergent policies, we have been able to reach unanimous. agreement on a statement defining our attitude to the questions which pose a challenge to the world today.
Mr. President, in your statement to the first meeting of the Colombo Powers last year, you asked, ""Where do we stand now, we the peoples of Asia and Africa?"" This Conference has enabled us, the peoples of Asia and Africa,

to define our position on this question. We pledge ourselves to promote mutual economic and cultural cooperation and wellbeing of our peoples, and knowledge and understanding of our ways of life. We stand for the fundamental principles of Human Rights and self-determination of peoples as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.
We pledge support for the restitution of the human rights of the Palestine Arab refugees, for a just settlement of the Palestine question and for the right of the people of North Africa to self-determination.
We stand for the equality of all races and all nations of mankind; we abhor the policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination which form the basis of Government and human relations in large regions of Africa and other parts of the world. We proclaim that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil which should be speedily brought to an end. We pledge our support to the cause of freedom and independence for all subject peoples. We call upon all the powers concerned to grant freedom and independence to such peoples. We demand a greater voice in the counsels of nations and greater opportunities to influence the events which are shaping the destiny of mankind. We declare that universal disarmament, inclusive

of all weapons, of effective international control IS imperative for the preservation of world peace. We solemnly warn all nations of the disaster that is bound to overtake the human race should war break out involving the use of thermonuclear weapons.
Finally, in our declaration on world peace and cooperation, we have ventured to set out principles, the observation of which is essential if peace is to be maintained and international cooperation and will-being promoted.
Mr. President, this, in short, IS our answer to your question. We commend it in all humility to the consideration and support of all peoples and all nations of the world.",address,,"Mohammed Ali, Pakistan",,Closing
"We survey our work in Bandung with pride and humility. But let us not be like the writer who told his friend: ""Have you heard ? I am writing a book on humility.
And let me tell you something; it is the last word on humility.""

It is not for us to assess our achievements at Bandung, Only history can make that pronouncement. We should all like history to say that men from 29 nations came together at time when the pulse-beat of the world was erratic and dangerously fast, and that as a result of what

we did, the health and vitality of the human community showed marked improvement.
We should all like history to say that though we did not provide the design for a perfect world, we did define the basis for hope.
We should all like history to say that we not only observed the newly won freedom of half the world's peoples but that we pooled our moral strength to help those who were not yet free to join this noble station.
We should like history to say that our freedom were more than merely celebrated at Bandung; they were made solid and given the substance of growth.
But we cannot in truth expect history to say all this because the work at Bandung has only begun. The real work and the real achievements of the Conference are ahead of us. What happens in the months and year ahead will determine whether the mood created at Bandung was momentary and misleading or whether it was strong and clean and vibrant.

What we have done here, in effect, was to define our own commitments. We share, generally speaking, a common historical experience. We belong to the community of hurt, heartbreak, and deferred hopes. But even in the act of observing our release, it becomes important to say what we ourselves propose to do by way of maintaining those freedoms and fulfilling those hopes.
What are the commitments made at Bandung ? believe that we have committed ourselves, first of all, to a higher allegiance. We have recognized that our allegiance is not merely to our own nations or to each other as Asians and Africans ; our first allegiance is to the human community. We have committed ourselves to something more important than to the accident of geography. We have committed ourselves to the cause of a world seeking both peace and freedom, for one is meaningless without the other.

And here, let me say that if the peace of the world is going to depend on concessions Or more abstentions, that will create a vital it will not be real. It is not what we refrain from doing vital peace. It is what we how much each freely give, of us is willing to sacrifice, and positive vivalues we contribute that will determine whether the

sion we see here at Bandung can be brought to life. And let merefer once again to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, who belongs not to India alone but to the world: ""How much we put of ourselves into a common purpose will determine whether that purpose will be fulfilled"". We have also committed ourselves to patience. Here at this Conference we have seen how, time and again, understanding could be reached if full allowance were made for the vagaries of human personality. We have not been defeated by petty behaviour nor have we allowed ourselves to become paralyzed by fatigue.
And patience is related to the art of persuasion. No one can say that such an art by itself can demolish fundamental differences, but certainly no issue can be settled without it.
I have been impressed, deeply, with the sincere attempt of all present to create-not a lasting organization, but a lasting effect. And when I say all J mean all. I have never seen a group of men SO finely animated by recognition of high purpose.

Now that we are leaving, let me express first of all the congratulations of the Philippine delegation to our host, the Government of Indonesia. The arrangements made for this Conference showed imagination, care, and efficiency of the highest order. I have also been asked by a considerable number of press correspondents to make a public expression of their Own gratitude to the Government of Indonesia and to say that they have nothing but the highest admiration for the depth of planning that has gone to the amazingly complicated problem of arranging for full press facilities.
To the host countries, the Colombo Powers, the Philippine delegation desires to extend its thanks. Their conception of this project is one of the great achievements and contributions of our time.
Philippines. We return with
Tomorrow, the Philippine delegation returns to the strong and important memories. These memories will grow in vitality with the years.

"Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates This is really a memorable first time in history the occasion, when for the representatives of Asian and African countries *have met together to consider of common interest and matters get to know each other in order to

promote friendly relations Apart from among them and their peoples. which because it has added to our prestige and moral value we could solve, the meeting in itself was significant any specific principles or particular problems among other nations of the world. In addition we have

succeeded in finding solutions for our various problems and from that point of view our talks have been remarkable and singular. Many of us have come to know each other better, where previously few of us knew enough of each other's country and peoples. If we could maintain those friendly relations which have been brought into being here, we would have gone a long way in securing future success. Within the short time which we had at OUr disposal and the intricate problems which we had to solve, I am sure that we have achieved a great deal of success. This is only a start and I am sure that our next steps will be more sure and more fruitful. For this reason I fervently hope that we would be able to attend the future sessions of this Conference. We should not be disheartened if our discussions seemed protracted at times. The views of some of us seem irreconcilable because this is our first attempt.

We must have patience and try once more because every day that passes brings with it more understanding, more harmony and more cooperation. Ultimately it will dawn on the human community as a whole that we should work in collaboration with one another for a better world understanding. However, despite the difficulties which we have to face, our progress has been singular to the extent that it reflects credit on the delegates assembled here, for their good intentions, sober motives and high standard of diplomacy.

The Sudanese delegation is really honoured to take its place among this distinguished body of able and leading statesmen. As I mentioned in my maiden speech, the Sudanese delegation has attended the deliberations of this Conference and its Committees with an open mind and has supported any motion which it has considered to be right, genuine and in the general interests of all nations, from wherever it came. We are very happy that we have been able to estabish friendly relations with many delegations. Before concluding I would like to repeat my thanks tO the-sponsoring countries and in particular to the Republic of Indonesia, who took great pains in organizing the Conference and making our stay here a very pleasant and memorable one. The Prime Minister of Indonesia has won our appreciation and gratitude for his wise conduct of the meetings and for the spirit which prevailed throughout our deliberations and thereby greatly contributed to the results achieved.

The previous distinguished speaker, the delegate from the Philippines, conveyed to us all and especially to Indonesia the gratitude and the thanks of the press. I, in my turn, must also thank the international press, which focused the attention of the world on this Conference and drew a polished picture of its objects and intentions.

We are at the end, yet we are at the beginning. The
Conference is at an end, but we are in the beginning of our rising of Asia and Africa to a modern power and to material strength, power and strength that shall not be in the service of imperialism and colonialism, the power and strength which we shall not throw on the side of aggression, war or invasion, the power and strength through which we shall build a free world a world not free from freedom, but a world dominated with universal freedom power and strength not only to build power and strength but to destroy imperialism to the last ditch and colonialism to the last vestige.
Mr. Chairman and distinguished Fellow Delegates !

Our Conference is the world in miniature. We mix in diversity, diversity of language, diversity of political forms, diversity of ideologies, diversity of social and economic order. In the meetings we have conflicting views; we do find dissenting opinions and sometimes there is danger of losing unanimity, the danger of disagreement. As a humble servant in the United Nations, ever since the establishment of the United Nations, I have never seen any resolutions having been passed with unanimity. We disagreed and

dissented, but finally we fell back on our hearts; we fell back upon our distress in the past; we fell back on our past in jails and concentration camps. At least I am happy to say that we adopted our resolutions unanimously in this framework of diversity. It was really, gentlemen, a miracle to achieve unanimity in this diversity, but we were determined and we did achieve that unanimity. But this is not an end of it, gentlemen. We do not end at this stage. We are unanimous today and we shall be unanimous tomorrow. Tomorrow is also a miracle to be unanimous, but we are determined to achieve that unanimity. Mr. Chairman, this is a great achievement indeed and we are proud of it. We are all united on the question of general peace, security and prosperity of all of us, after all one's claim of peace and security is claim of pride. You all know, gentlemen, that Asia has produced messengers of peace and has sent messages of peace in all generations in the forms of prophets, masters and teachers.. We have given the world the mission of peace and given the world the messages of peace. We as accredited successors of those great leaders, masters and teachers shall continue to give the world the mission of peace. We shall continue to carry the banners of peace to our fellow-beings troughout the length and breadth of the globe.

Mr. Chairman, on this specific problem we have spoken

our minds clearly, with boldness and unequivocation, namely on the question of Palestine, Algeria, Tunisia and Yemen, and also West Irian. We have supported the cause of these people through no egoism, through no discrimination, because we believe in universal righteousness and justice. And it Is our duty, Mr. Chairman, and Ladies and Gentlemen, to be relentless and unceasing in our efforts so that these people achieve their national aspirations, so that in future Conferences we see them seated amongst us here as legitimate representatives of Palestine, of the people of Algeria, of the people of Morocco, of the people of Tunisia, with honour and distinction.
With regard to Indonesia, their cause is near our hearts. In addition, the hospitality that we have received from the host Government, not out of generosity and courtesy of the Indonesian Government, but because gentlemen, it is a historical coincidence that Indonesia is the cradle of our Conference. It is saddening, dispiriting and disappointing that we assemble here at a time when West Irian is not included in the territorial sovereignty of the Indonesian Republic and in fairness to our principles and in fairness

to the cradle of this Conference, our combined efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere must always be asserted so that in the next Conference we see West Irian included in the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia.
Finally, Mr. Chairman, at the end of the recommendations passed by this Conference, there is a significant recommendation adopted by the Conference without any hesitation and it recommends that the Asian-African Conference should meet at the proper time and place after consultation with the participating countries. This recommendation is of paramount importance, of great significance. Simply this declaration to the world indicates that we are not at an end of our work. In fact, we declare to the world that we are only at the beginning and we declare that we shall continue to meet, cooperate with each other, discuss our problems with each other and pool our efforts and resources together till we see that all signs of imperialism and colonialism are destroyed in the world completely,

I wish to begin my statement by expressing again _our gratitude to the people and Government of the brother nation of Indonesia for the hospitality which they have so graciously exented to us in this city of Bandung which has become for ever historic, and I want to thank the five sponsoring countries for having taken the initiative to bring us together in this Conference which has ended so successfully.
I consider it a of pleasant duty to say that a large measure great success is due to the ability and patience of our Chairman, His Excellency Ali Sastroamidjojo, the Prime Minister of Indonesia, and to the great talents and qualities of our Rapporteur, His Royal Highness Prince Wan of Thailand.

The Asian African Conference has now terminated its work. 29 delegations coming from countries thousands miles views apart have been assembled here to exchange their on most of the outstanding problems of the world.
We have met here with friendly with which and brotherly countries, we have continual contacts, with other countries with which we have no diplomatic representation and also with still other countries whose governments we do not recognise, but with all these countries we have established something stronger the heart, stronger and more lasting: relations If we think of the vastness of the question set before us, if we think of the divergence of outlook and of use on

many essential problems, I believe we must consider the Conference as having very successfully accomplished its purpose and rendered a great service to humanity at large. One common aspiration has dominated every phase of our deliberations our desire-for peace and security and our conviction of the necessity of cooperation to maintain peace through security and confidence.
This is a source of rejoicing for us all, and we hope in all sincerity that these ideals shall find their implementation in all our practices and actions.
As we go back to our countries, it is our earnest desire to take from this Conference the hope that no member of this Conference shall resort to the use of force unless it is attacked, no matter what its particular problem may be and no matter whether it considers this problem of a national or international character. the decisions This will be the test of our determination to implement which we have adopted.

The principles of the United Nations have been upheld by all the members of this Conference.
Our discussions in the Conference have confirmed our aversion to racialism and to colonialism in all its manifestations.
Through the voice of many of its members, a momentous appeal has arisen from within this Conference for the respect and safeguard of the political, social, economical, spiritual and intellectual way of life of all countries, big or small, and for the condemnation not only of classical colonialism but also of the new types of colonialism practiced by certain international doctrines through infiltration, subversion or the use of force.
The Turkish delegation is particularly pleased that the Conference has dwelt upon effective and realistic measures for maintaining security. The fact that the Conference has reaffirmed the principles of the United Nations Charter

on the formation of regional defensive organisation and that the final communique includes this affirmation is also a matter which has given us great satisfaction as it proves again that the nations of the world are conscious of the realities.
The linking together of disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons is also important.
In summing up, the contribution of the Conference to the cause of peace and security has been of considerable importance. Our common affirmation of our love of peace, freedom and independence will resound with vigour over the entire world.
May our actions and practices bring additional strength to this momentous message which we are conveying to the world.

"Mr. Chairman, Fellow Delegates
Our Conference has been a success.
We have manifested our common aspiration for peaceful co-existence between the Asian and African countries and between the countries of the world, our strong opposition to colonial oppression, war, nuclear weapons and common weapons of mass destruction; we have shown a desire, and laid down principles, for economic cooperation and cultural exchanges. By exchanges of views, contacts, understanconciliatory attitude and good will, the mutual ding and friendship between our countries have increased. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam feels gratified at such a successful outcome.
In the course of this Conference, I felt deeply grieved at the sight of a Viet-Nam not yet unified. This is but a temporary situation. As provided for by the Geneva agreements, the demarcation line which lies between North and South Viet-Nam is only a provisional one. The present situation is just a stage which must lead to the reunification of Viet-Nam by free and democratic election.

the North
Therefore, the entire Vietnamese people, from to the South, without any discrimination, are resolved to souls for this unity, at struggle with all their hearts and the same time for the consolidation of peace. These two tasks are intimately connected to each other. In this holy struggle, we all are confident in the warm support of the Asian and African peoples. That support we have

had the opportunity to sense it in this Conference; we have sensed it at the contact with the warm-hearted people who are our host. On behalf of my people, I express with deep emotion our thankfulness and solidarity to all the supporters of our cause, which, since it is a just cause, will certainly triumph.
In connection with the question of the promotion of world peace, one of the main purposes of this Assembly, I should like to stress here the importance of the Geneva agreements which have made a great contribution to the lessening of tension In South East Asia and in the world. The full and correct implementation of these accords will undoubtedly serve the cause of peace in Asia, Africa and the world.
This Delegation again states in unequivocal terms the resolve of the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam to carry out fully and loyally the Geneva agreements, in order to consolidate peace, to achieve the unity and to complete the independence of Viet-Nam.

In this struggle, we do rely on the support of the Asian and African peoples, as we firmly believe in their ideal of justice and peace.
The Vietnamese people believe that at the next session of the Asian-African Conference there will be the delegation of unified Viet-Nam.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of VietNam expresses its sincere thanks to the sponsoring powers of this Conference, to the Chairman of this Conference, to the Indonesian people, to the Bandung authorities and population for their warm reception, to the Conference

staff for their contribution to the success of the Conference. This delegation extends its best greetings to all the fellow delegations to this Conference.

"Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen
At the close of this memorable Conference, the delegation of the State of Viet-Nam wishes to express again its deep gratitude to the Government and people of Indonesia and the five sponsoring Powers.
Coming to this Conference, we knew that there are a number of problems which are common to the Asian and African nations and which we should consider together. But we knew also that each nation has to consider the same problems in its own ways, because each country has its own existence to maintain and its own destiny to prepare.
President Soekarno, in his opening speech, has expressed the noble wish that this Conference would help to build the future of mankind with dreams and not with the past. Alas Each country has also its own history, paved with many memories, some happy, others painful and for that reason, the more lasting.
It iS why we should not be surprised that unanimity could not be acquired on all problems. We should on the

contrary be happy and comforted that some proposals have been adopted by this Conference.
These results are in line with the process which should lead us toward truth. For, in political matters, truth is not simple, especially because each one of us believes he holds his own truth. It seems fortunate, however, that this Conference has not given way to the terrible temptation to believe that only the greatest, the most numerous and the best organised ones, hold the monopoly of truth. It is because this Conference has assisted to the simplification of truth that it has shown the most understanding attitude toward the problems which have been submitted for its consideration.
That understanding is the very basis of tolerance and friendship. And I am proud to say today at the end of this Conference, that the Asian and African nations have succeeded during their first meeting in giving to the whole world that example of wisdom.
On behalf of the people and the delegation of the State of Viet-Nam I thank you all.",address,,"Nguyen Van Thoai, State Of Viet-Nam",,Closing

"Indonesian Observer, Djakarta, April 25, 1955
CONCLUSION OF A HISTORIC EVENT
The Asian African Conference convened upon the invitation of the Prime Ministers of Indonesia, India, Burma, Ceylon and Pakistan in Bandung came to a close yesterday evening. Problems of common interest and concern to the countries of Asia and Africa were discussed in a way which never has occurred before in international conferences.
Questions will probably be raised by cynics what actually are the results of this 29-Nations gathering? Has the conference achieved its aim, Or was it just a teaparty of no importance to current international problems? Undoubtedly this conference achieved its aim as planned by the initiators.

The Asian and African nations, some just having or gained their independence, others still semi-colonies independent in name came together to talk about their common problem which was not confined to political issues only. Economic and cultural development of these nations in their own boundaries were the issues which had to be discussed among neighbours in the first place. closer
The people of Asia and Africa should promote cooperation for the well being of the nations concerned. It is quite heartening to know that the Asian-African Conference has come to a close after unanimously accepting a communique which will have a farreaching influence on the continents in the world. The resolution on economic cooperation has for instance been accepted to open the way for encouragement of joint ventures among AsianAfrican Countries for the benefit of common interest. Other sidelines of economic cooperation have been stipulated in to be carthe decision of the 29 nations, and all these have ried out genuinely for mutual economic interest. Next comes

the cultural cooperation. In the past cultural cooperation among Asian and African nations was unthinkable, as national cultures did not have the freedom to be developed. Colonialism in many parts of Asia and Africa not only prevented national culture to develop but also suppressed it In order to give place to the culture of the oppressors. The human right and selfdetermination-resolution was also a masterpiece of joint effort to make the conference a success. Decision on problems of dependent peoples, promotion of world peace and cooperation are in fact the highlights of the historic Asian-African Conference. The last resolutions are contributed by men of great responsibilities for the welfare of mankind. The different views of the nations in the A-A Conference did not hamper to produce these resolutions which are of such a historical value and have had no comparison in the past.

Some of the Asian and African nations have close relations with colonial powers. They are allies or members of a pact or pacts in which the colonial powers play an important role. But in whatever position they are, they did not reject the genuine atmosphere prevailing in the conference hall to bring an end to colonialism as ""subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitute a denial of fundamental human rights"".
The promotion of world peace and cooperation was a problem which was not easy to overcome. Conflicting interpretation of ""peace"" was 2 drawback in finding a meeting of mind among the opposing views.
But mutual understanding, sO necessary In human relations and international cooperation and conciliatory attitude emanating from a genuine desire for tranquility and peace in this world was the motive behind the resolution adopted. The dangerous situation of international tension which exists and the risks confronting mankind from the outbreak of global war in which could be employed nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons, made it a duty of the

conference and to express an appeal to the Powers concerned not to ignore the voice of two third of the world population.
The promotion of peace is not only based on the suspension of using nuclear and thermonuclear weapons or disarmament in a big scale, but the right of selfdetermination should also be accepted as a means of promoting peace. Freedom and peace are interdependent. Freedom from mistrust and fear, and with confidence and goodwill towards each other, practicing tolerance and live together as good neighbours, respect from the right of nation to defend itself singly or collectively, settlements of all international disputes by peaceful means are the fundamental issues to promote world peace.
Peace, genuine peace as hoped by all the Asian and African nations was the Leitmotiv to convene the Conference. Whatever ideology the individual A-A nation may have, these nations have come to 2 conclusion that peace must be preserved for common prosperity of all.

In putting this desire in words which formulate the hope of two-third of the world's population, the AsianAfrican leaders made the Asian-African Conference a historical event, which cannot be ignored or belittled.",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"Pakistan Times, Lahore, April 27, 1955
The Asian-African parleys, which concluded on Sunday evening, ended on a note of unanimity. for the political future of two continents and the teeming millions who inhabit them. At one stage, the Conference seemed destined to break up under the conflicting pulls of the seemingly irreconcilable opinions. But some of these differences were solved and in the end the Conference succeeded to 2 considerable extent in satisfying its sponsors' wish that it should symbolise the new spirit of freedom which animates the feelings and the actions of the newly awakened peoples of
Asia and Africa.

The unique Bandung Conference has cemented solidarity between Asia and Africa and it has indirectly shown the path to the two much exploited continents to realise their destiny of freedom and equality. Bandung has brought twenty-nine nations with different political systems and ideologies onto the the same platform and has shown what aspirations they share among themselves. There cannot be any doubt that Bandung is going to have a profound impact on the present trends in international relations, on the struggles which are being conducted by the subject peoples and on the unequal relationship that has so long existed between the Western countries on the one hand and the many lands of Asia and Africa on the other. Notwithstanding the serious definition disputes that cropped up overthe disarmament, of colonialism and the principles of peace and there were successes which cannot but successively lead to the strengthening of freedom and peace.

The direct personal contacts which were established amongst the statesmen and the leaders of the twenty-nine Asian-African nations has without doubt helped to foster better understanding of one another's point of view. In some cases these have produced most remarkable results. The conversations which Chou En-lai had separately with the leaders of the Colombo Powers provided an opportunity, such as could not be furnished by diplomatic channels, for a free and frank exchange of opinions on 2 number of vital questions which affect free relations and peace in South-East Asia. To the impulse which was provided by these exchanges is attributed Chou En-lai's dramatic offer to negotiate directly with the United States for the purpose of bringing about a relaxation of tension in the Formosa area and in the Far East generally. Another result is the acceptance by the leader of the Cambodian delegation of the Chinese Premier's invitation to visit China in order to discuss the implementation of the Geneva Agreement. Lastly the contacts between the Chinese délegation and the representatives of the Arab states have encouraged the hope that at least some of the latter will find it possible to extend diplomatic recognition to Peking.

Some of the resolutions passed by the Conference embody fullblooded expression of Afro-Asian sentiments and these generally concern issues on which the participants had a large measure of unanimity.-Under this category fall the resolutions which lend support for Indonesia in respect of West-Irian, to the peoples of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia in their struggle for their rights and to the demands of the Arab States that the United Nations resolutions on Palestine should be implemented. Under the same category can be classed the forthright resolutions reaffirming the determination of the Asian and African peoples to eradicate racialism and deploring the policies and the practice of racial segregation and discrimination. The Conference, however, ran into serious difficulties when it sought to define its attitude towards colonialism. On the question of peace and co-existence the participants have been known for a long time to have been pursuing widely divergent policies. It has been proved impossible to narrow down these differences to any considerable extent and to pave the way for an understanding which could enable the states of Asia and Africa to work for their invidual and collective security while at the same time steering

clear of the conflict between the two blocks. The ten point ""charter of co-existence"" has been framed in a manner so as to permit the forging of military alliances and participation therein even when such alliances involve acceptance of colonialism as is shown by the NATO' guarantees to France's North African Empire and in increasing the danger of war.
The greatest difficulty arose when it came to the question of defining and condemning the curse of colonialism. Here it was found that the participants, many of whom have only recently succeeded in shaking off the

yoke of imperialism, did not know how to evolve an agreed definition of the phenomenon of colonialism. There was vacillation and equivocation on the question of identifying and exposing something which has been or even now IS SO familiar to the peoples of Asia and Africa. It was left to Sir John Kotelawala, Ceylon's Prime Minister, to bring in the extraneous question of ideological affiliations by referring to the Socialist Republics of East Europe. Sir John evidently forgot that colonialism and ideological alignment were two different things. An attack on British colonialism, for instance involves a condemnation of the metropolitan power's occupation and exploitation of another country but it does not mean a denunciation of the political system obtaining in Britain. It is a matter of great regret that our spokesmen at the Conference should have strengthened the hands of the Ceylon's Premier and should thus have been instrumental In watering down the Conference's attitude towards a phenomenon which is responsible for so much suffering and misery in the world and which is based on the simple logic of barbarism.

It is also difficult to understand why the Pakistan representative opposed the idea of the Conference which criticised certain U.N. policies. While some of the moves made by Pakistan were creditable, others gave the impression that Pakistan was functioning as a member of what may be called the U.S. lobby at Bandung. Although Mohammad Ali's statement that Pakistan will not join any aggressive war started by America will be received with welcome relief in this country, the people may well ask themselves why the Government has put itself in a position that made such a statement necessary. The people of Pakistan cannot resign themselves to the Government's close association with the Anglo-American bloc and the consequent change in our foreign policy, including moderation of our attitude towards colonialism. The whole gamut of foreign relations needs to be reviewed, and a return to Pakistan's earlier policies to be brought about by public pressure.

It is earnestly hoped that the next Conference of Asian and African nations will display a greater sense of common destiny and greater and greater awareness of the community of social and political ideals which lie at the bottom of the movement for Afro-Asian resurgence, and that Pakistan will be able to play a more effective part in promoting these ideals and in helping Asia and Africa to attain peace and freedom.",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"The Philippines Herald, April 26, 1955 BANDUNG AND THE MODERN WORLD

Asian-African
Judging by the final communique of the conference which came to a close over the weekend and by the reaction shown in the main capitals of the world, Bandung will go down in history as marking an entirely new era in world relations. It is epochal in its significance and

of far-reaching consequences in the future relations of peoples, races and continental groups, particularly in its impact in a regime of power politics which has heretofore dominated international affairs. It set a power balance between the under-developed nations and ""submerged races"" on the one hand and the stronger and better. developed western colonizing group that has held control over much of the surface of the earth for so long on the other.
Bandung derived its strength from the great moral forces of the cause that it represented and the vast, though still latent, power of more than half the word's population now organizing for common advancement and security. The agreements and proceedings in the conference will exert a tremendous influence in future world relations because behind them is an aroused public conscience and a mobilized opinion of inter-hemispheric scope. It just cannot be ignored. It cannot be taken lightly by the so-called world powers. It will have to be heeded and respected from here on.

Perhaps the outstanding achievement of the AsianAfrican conference has been to prove the maturity of the leadership of the peoples therein represented and its capacity and vigor to integrate half-a-world in the interest of common causes and aims. This alone will have the effect of putting up a stop-sign beyond which further abuse and exploitation of the weak and the poor by the strong and the rich will not be countenanced or tolerated. Their views can no longer be deliberately disregarded. Theirs will not be the same lone and weak voices that have often been too easily lost in the deliberations of international forums and councils.
The unanimity of action on the remedies and solutions that Bandung offered toward overcoming the ills and fears which nations in Asia and Africa suffer constitute incontrovertible evidence of the strength that Bandung generated. That strength may be merely potential for the time being but its reality can no longer be doubted. For sometime to come, the power that it wields will be moral but even now that is perhaps the only force that no nation or bloc of nations, however militarily strong, will dare challenge.

It IS not important to record which group or which nation won more points than others. Nor 1S it necessary to emphasize that the views of one delegate were more ably presented or warmly accepted than those of another. What is truly of historic moment is that there has been found, after laborious negotiation and conciliation, a meeting of minds on the more vital issues with which the peoples of Asia and Africa are deeply concerned.
It is, of course, pleasant for us Filipinos, as it must be for our friends in the democratic camp, that our General Romulo has so distinguished himself in the defence of our interests and those of the Free World but we should be prouder yet that his greater contribution to the success of the conference consisted in being able to exert his vast

experience and influence in the direction of helping bring closer together and unify peoples of divergent origins and needs never before afforded the opportunity to think and act as a group In their own interest. Defence of our own policies of an ideological character, however brilliant and impressive, in itself would merely have accentuated. the animosities and conflicts that now beset all humanity. the
In the sense that the Bandung conference made world aware of the dangers arising from the crisis over Formosa, even the debates on that subject may be held to have contributed to lessening the tension in the Far Eastern situation.
For now, Communist China cannot possibly overlook the gravely expressed concern of so many of the participants in the conference over the dangers of an explo-

sion that may spark a world conflagration. And it is entirely possible that realization of this fact may have led Chou En-lai to make the wholly unexpected gesture of pretending to be ameable to a peaceful settlement of the Formosa issue in direct negotiations between Red China to. the and the United States. If so, let this again be credited collective wisdom and influence of the conference.
The nations represented in Bandung equally share credit for the success of the conference and deserve congratulations. We should accord 10 our delegation, under the able leadership of General Romulo, due to return this evening, public recognition and our proud appreciation of the significant role that it played to help achieve that success.",press,,,Asia and Africa,
"Manchester Guardian, Britain, April 23, 1955
The Bandung conference has been full of confused noise (though fortunately not with garments rolled in blood). It was bound to be so. A conference of twenty-nine Governments and with no agenda in advance could not be orderly and tidy. The ex-Mufti of Jerusalem and the Ethnarch of Cyprus had to be fitted in as well as the delegates of Governments. But behind the smoke it iS possible to see a pattern of events. Though most of the proceedings were supposedly in secret, this has not prevented the publication of detailed accounts of the brushes between the delegates and of their demeanour. At the start of the conference some of the countries were evidently set on preventing China from dominating or manipulating it. The conference had risen out of the activities of the Colombo countries: there was anxiety to see that it was not appropriated by Peking, Who can say that Sir John Kotelawala, the Prime Minister of Ceylon, did not make a most spirited attempt to save the conference from being bewitched by sophistries ? The challenge of little Ceylon to the mighty Chinese Empire will have won a lot of

sympathy. But some of the delegates who thought like him made such vigorous attacks on communism that they may have overlayed their hand and won a more sympathetic hearing for Mr. Chou En-lai. The blandness 'of Mr. Chou En-lai countered them. He has been businesslike, affable, approachable, and brief. He has held himself in check from retorting in kind. He was able to state, apparently without exciting derision, that the presence of Nai Pridi in Yunnan recruiting ""Free Thais"" was not a threat to Siam. conference
He acted skilfully in choosing the as the place at which to sign the treaty with
Indonesia of the overseas regulating the question of the dual nationality Chinese, about which the countries of free Asia have been SO anxious. This conference, coming after

Geneva, has shown again that if conference diplomacy is employed in solving the problems of Asia, Mr. Chou Enlai will play a formidable part.
The trial of strength at the conference between China and its critics was postponed yesterday and may be settled to-day. China is opposing a declaration against ""infiltration and subversion"" which has been tacked on to the resolution calling for all colonies in Asia and Africa to be freed within a time-limit. It must strike some delegates as sinister that Mr. Chou En-lai objects to this declaration, however friendly he may appear. The conflict with China has distracted attention from what should be the main business of the conference. It was a good idea for the Governments of Asia to come together and confer upon the dangerous tensions in Asia. The worst of these is over Formosa. The Asian countries have every right to play a part in trying to avert calamity there: life and death for them depends on what happens. Perhaps Sir John Kotelawala was premature in thinking that the time had come for the Colombo countries to mediate. There cannot usefully be a conference about Formosa until the main parties signify, perhaps indirectly and cryptically, that they

are at last ready to bargain. In the meanwhile let the problem be talked about, let all possible solutions be advanced, let all possible weight of public opinion be mobilised in order to persuade the parties to keep well away from shooting. Discussion of this kind and the making of public opinion was obviously one of the main purposes of the Bandung conference. It must be hoped that it has been achieved.
It will not be possible to assess the results of the conference until it has been over for some time. This is a conference which cannot be judged simply by the not very startling resolutions which it has passed. Many political leaders are meeting each other for the first time. Ideas are being propounded to them in kind of tropical

atmosphere which may make them more compelling than they have been in the past. What has gone on in the discussions outside the conference halls will probably be more important than the official transactions. The effects will have to be observed in the groupings of Asian Governments during the next few months. It would be a pity if anything which had happened at Bandung jeopardised the intimate co-operation of the smaller group the Colombo countries which sponsored the conference. Countries and persons have put their prestige at stake, and the results will presently show. It will be interesting to compare in retrospect the impact made by Mr. Chou En-lai and by Mr. Nehru. Perhaps the conference will have disseminated information which may effect action. The Chinese delegates can scarcely travel back to Peking with none of their misconceptions in any way affected: China's isolation might be broken down still more if China acted on the conference resolution to promote a freer exchange of news in the press. One fact should be kept in mind: this has been a conference of Governments, not of peoples. It would be wrong therefore to quote its views as expressing the spirit of the peoples of Asia: even if Mr. Nehru can claim with

some justice to speak for all India, eminent Chinese like Dr. Hu Shih would certainly deny the claim of Mr. Chou En-lai to speak for China. The Bandung conference was first thought of and created in a rather haphazard way and has grown into an Asian convention with more ambitious purposes than were at first thought of. Bandung may not be allowed to sink into history as a singular and curious

gathering which striking events of the day had made possible: Asian conventions may instead become a regular instituation. What has so far happened at Bandung suggests that this would be useful in spite of the disputes without which no convention is interesting.",press,,,Europe,
"Pravda, Moscow, 28-4-'55 Great changes are taking place on the continents of Asia and Africa. In Asia the end has come for imperialism. Asian-African peoples are making a great contribution to peace. The meeting was not attended by the representatives of old Asia and Africa. That's why the old masters of the colonial world met the Conference with hostility. The colonial powers, especially the U.S.A tried to sow discord at the Conference in order to prevent any agreement being reached, but failed in their intrigues. The Bandung Conference achieved results because it did not depend on U.S.A. dictations as have taken place in U.N.O.

It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the Bandung Conference. The main characteristic of the decisions is their anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism which are serious blows to the colonial powers. The Bandung Conference made a great contribution to the strengthening of the national conscience of the AsianAfrican peoples, which iS a new step towards developing cooperation. Its decisions will help to lessen international tension and preserve peace. The peoples of the U.S.S.R. greet the success of the Bandung Conference.",press,,,Europe,

Powell believed that a more tolerant and kind gesture of Eisenhower by extending cordial greetings to Bandung would have been much better appreciated.

"Canbera Times, 22 April, 1955
The discussions have led to a useful stock-taking, though not necessarily as expected by the chief sponsors. It could never have been claimed seriously that the conference •was representative of Africa.
The fact that the Asian delegates have not been in agreement on many points shows that the Asian countries are thinking and speaking for themselves and decline to have their policies shaped in a common mould fashioned either in the East or West. The most impressive passages of the conference have been the criticism of communism and the declaration of concern lest the future of Asia be dominated by an ideology foreign to the faith of the millions of Asian. This is a demonstration to the rest of the world that if Asia resists the influence from the West, it is also determined to combat un-Asian activities from the Bast. In the West, events are shaping towards a meeting with Russia, Asian discussions may bring a new approach to the settlement of outstanding Asian problems. Altogether, a new chapter 1S about to open IN seeking a firmer postwar settlement.

Writing in the April issue of ""VOICE"", in connection with the Asian-African Conference, Dr. Burton stated that on any reading of the U.N. Charter, Seato was quite contrary to its provisions governing regional arrangements as set out in chapter eight. The Asian African Conference on the other hand was strictly within the terms of the Charter. Australia and the U.S.A had determined to maintain Chiang and Rhee, and colonialism in Malaya and
Dutch New Guinea.
In its editorial, the ""Voice"" stated as follows: ""Perhaps the most important result of the Asian-African Conference is its reminder to the Western World: Asia is no longer a number of countries blanketed in a feudal past, but mostly emancipated from feudal and colonial bonds and bringing with them the determination that their, entry into the twentieth century will not be still-born in the ideological conflict engulfing the West. The failure to appreciate this fact can not only lead to the unnecessarily precipitous foreign policy, but can build antipathy where friendship and goodwill are most needed. It is in this context that the recent foreign policy statements by both the Federal Government and the Labour Party need to be approached.
