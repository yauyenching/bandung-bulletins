This project aims to provide an easily accessible at-a-glance visual summary of the 1955 Asian-African Conference bulletin contents which were made publicly available by the Indonesian ministry of information. Users can filter the output according to content categories, delegate head, and press region. This project was completed as part of my digital humanities project for the module YHU3263 The Bandung Conference of 1955 at Yale-NUS College.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation ##
This web app was made using the R [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package and deployed on the platform [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

## üìÇ File Structure ##
This is a single-file app. Both the UI and server-side code can be found in `.\app.R`.

## üíæ Data ##
The conference bulletins are available [here](https://bandung60.wordpress.com/bandung-bulletin/). I digitized them manually using optical character recognition technology. My digitization output can be found [here](https://github.com/yauyenching/bandung-bulletins/tree/main/document_text).

## üö© Known Issues ##
* **The word cloud does not dynamically resize in the event of window resizing.** One should refresh the page to resize the word cloud.
* **The output is not 100% accurate.** The PDFs were not of high quality, so mispelled words can be found.
